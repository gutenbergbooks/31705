<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>This small volume is based upon three lectures
on Eugenics delivered at Oberlin College
in April, 1910. In preparing them for publication
many extensions and a few additions
have been made in order to present the subject
more adequately and to include some very recent
results of eugenic investigation.</p>

<p>Few subjects have come into deserved prominence
more rapidly than has Eugenics. Biologists,
social workers, thoughtful students and
observers of human life everywhere, have felt
the growing necessity for some kind of action
leading to what are now recognized as eugenic
ends. Hitherto the lack of guiding principles
has left us in the dark as to where to take hold
and what methods to pursue. To-day, however,
progress in the human phases of biological
science clearly gives us clews regarding modes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
of attack upon many of the fundamental problems
of human life and social improvement and
progress, and suggests concrete methods of
work.</p>

<p>The present essay does not represent an
original contribution to the subject of Eugenics.
It is not a complete statement of the facts and
foundations of Eugenics in any particular. It
is rather an attempt to state briefly and suggestively,
in simple, matter-of-fact terms the
present status of this science. While Eugenics
is a social topic in practice, in its fundamentals,
in its theory, it is biological. It is therefore
necessary that the subject be approached primarily
from the biological point of view and
with some familiarity with biological methods
and results. The control of human evolution&mdash;physical,
mental, moral&mdash;is a serious subject of
supremest importance and gravest consequents.
It must be considered without excitement&mdash;thoughtfully,
not emotionally.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that no one can
speak of the subject of Eugenics without feeling
the immensity of his debt to Sir Francis
Galton and to Professor Karl Pearson. From
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
the writings of these pioneers I have drawn
heavily in this essay. The recent summary of
the Whethams, and Davenport's valuable essay
on Eugenics have also served as the sources of
quotation.</p>

<h3>THE SOURCES AND AIMS OF THE SCIENCE OF EUGENICS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"Bravas to all impulses sending sane children to the next age!"<br />
</p></div>


<p>Eugenics has been defined as "the science of being well born." In the
words of Sir Francis Galton, who may fairly be claimed as the founder
of this newest of sciences, "Eugenics is the study of the agencies
under social control, that may improve or impair the racial qualities
of future generations, either physically or mentally."</p>


<p>The idea of definitely undertaking to improve the innate
characteristics of the human race has been expressed repeatedly
through centuries&mdash;fancifully, seriously, hopefully, and now
scientifically. Since the times of Theognis and of Plato the
student of animate Nature has been aware of the possibility
of the degradation or of the elevation of the human
race-characters. The conditions under which life exists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
gradually change: the customs and ideals of
societies change rapidly. Times inevitably
come when, if we are to maintain or to advance
our racial position, we find it necessary to
change in an adaptive way our attitude toward
these changing social relations and conditions
of life. If we neglect to do this we go down in
the racial struggle, as history so clearly and so
repeatedly warns us.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many biologists and sociologists
such a time has now arrived. The suspension
of many forms of natural selection in
human society, the currency of the "rabbit
theory" of racial prosperity&mdash;based upon the
idea of mere numerical increase of the population,
the complacent disregard of the increase
of the pauper, insane, and criminal elements of
our population, the dearth of individuals of
high ability&mdash;even of competent workmen, all
are resulting in evil and will result disastrously
unless deliberately controlled. It is hoped
that this control, though at first conscious,
"artificial," may later become fixed as an element
of social custom and conscience and thus operate
automatically and the more effectively. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
result will be not only the restoration of our
race to its original vigor, mental and physical,
but further the carrying on of the race to a surpassing
vigor and supremacy.</p>

<p>The aim of Eugenics is the production of a
more healthy, more vigorous, more able humanity.
Again in the words of Galton "The aim
of Eugenics is to represent each class ... by
its best specimens; that done to leave them to
work out their common civilization in their own
way.... To bring as many influences as can
be reasonably employed to cause the useful
classes in the community to contribute more
than their present proportion to the next generation";
and further, we might add, to cause
the useless, vicious classes to contribute to the
next generation less than their present proportion.</p>

<p>With this definition of Eugenics and preliminary
statement of its aims before us we may
proceed to a somewhat fuller statement of the
facts within this field. First let us consider the
relation of the science of Eugenics to its parent
sciences, biology and sociology, then after mentioning
some of the steps in the development of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
the present eugenic movement, we may describe
some of the conditions which give us human
beings pause and lead us to appreciate the
necessity for a reconsideration of much that enters
into our present social organization and
conduct.</p>

<p>Shortly before the publication of "The
Origin of Species," Darwin was asked by Alfred
Russell Wallace whether he proposed to
include any reference to the evolution of man.
Darwin's reply was: "You ask whether I shall
discuss man. I think I shall avoid the whole
subject, as so surrounded with prejudices;
though I fully admit that it is the highest and
most interesting problem for the naturalist."
This prejudice which Darwin knew would preclude
a just consideration of the subject of
man's origin and evolution, grew out of the
former and long current conception of the position
occupied by man in the whole scheme of
Nature&mdash;of "Man's Place in Nature."</p>

<p>This conception, happily obsolete now among
thinkers, though occasionally seen lurking in
out of the way corners shaded from the light
of modern philosophy and science, placed Man
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and the rest of the universe in separate categories.
Man was one, all the rest another. It
was for Man's benefit or pleasure that the rains
descended, that the corn grew and ripened, that
the sun shone, the birds sang, the landscape
was spread before the view. For Man's warning
or punishment the lightning struck, comets
appeared, disease ravaged, insects tormented
and destroyed. It was certainly very natural
that Man should regard himself as a thing
apart, particularly since he was able to control
and to regulate Nature, and to take tribute
from her so extensively. But the scientist regarded
man differently; from him the world
learned to recognize man as an integral factor
in Nature&mdash;as one with Nature, possessing the
same structures, performing the same activities,
as other animals; subject to much the same
control and with much the same purposes
in life and in Nature as other living things. There
is to-day no necessity to enlarge upon this view.
As Ray Lankester puts it: "Man is held to be
a part of Nature; a being, resulting from and
driven by the one great nexus of mechanism
which we call Nature."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
But the echoes of the older na&iuml;ve view of Man
and his Nature sounded long after the rational
scientific conception had become dominant. It
is not so very long ago that psychology was little
more than human psychology; nor has sociology
long since gone outside the purely human
for explanations of the facts of human
society. Nowadays, however, psychology has
a firm comparative basis and sociology finds
much that is illuminating and helpful in the
purely biological aspects of the human animal.
Very naturally, then, we have had social science
studying man as Man, with a capital M:
biological science studying man as a natural
animal.</p>

<p>But now that modern trend of scientific synthesis
which has brought forth a Physical-Chemistry
and a Chemical-Physiology and a
Bio-Chemistry, is combining the purely social
and the purely biological studies of man into
a new Bio-Sociology. And as one phase of this
new partnership we have the subject of Eugenics&mdash;the
science of racial integrity and progress,
built upon the overlapping fields of Biology
and Sociology.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
We can trace the idea, perhaps better the
hope, of Eugenics from the modern times of
ancient Greece. Plato laid stress upon the idea
of the "purification of the State." In his Republic
he pointed out that the quality of the
herd or flock could be maintained only by breeding
from the best, consciously selected for that
purpose by the shepherd, and by the destruction
of the weaklings; and that when one was
concerned with the quality of his hunting dogs
or horses or pet birds, he was careful to utilize
this knowledge. He drew attention to the necessity
in the State for a functionary corresponding
to the shepherd to weed out the undesirables
and to prevent them from multiplying
their kind. Plato stated clearly the essential
idea of the inheritance of individual qualities
and the danger to the State of a large and increasing
body of degenerates and defectives.
He called upon the legislators to purify the
State. But the legislators paid no heed. The
able-bodied and able-minded continued to be
sacrificed to the God of War; the degenerates
and defectives&mdash;not fit to fight&mdash;were the ones
left at home to become parents of the next generation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
And to-day Greece remains an awful
warning.</p>

<p>We cannot describe or even enumerate the
wrecks of the many plans for race improvement
that are strewn from Plato to our day.
Sporadic, emotional, visionary, often it must
be confessed suggested by possibilities of material
gain to the "leader"&mdash;they have all passed.
They failed because they were unscientific; because
there was available no solid foundation
of determined fact upon which to build. One
need suggest only the Oneida Community, as
it was originally planned, or the Parisian society
of <i>L'Elite</i>&mdash;in both of which the selection
of mates was to be carefully controlled&mdash;or
some of the fantasies of Bernard Shaw, to indicate
the character of these failures.  Only
recently have we become able to suggest the
possibility of race improvement by scientific
methods, and only very recently has the possibility
appeared in the light of a necessity, the
alternative being the universal reward of the
unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The present eugenic movement may be said
to date from 1865 when Francis Galton showed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
that mental qualities are inherited just as are
physical qualities, and pointed out that this
opened the way to an improvement of the race
in all respects. The data in support of this
pregnant conclusion were included in Galton's
work on "Hereditary Genius" published in
1869, when he again emphasized definitely the
possibility and desirability of improving the
natural qualities of the human race. His suggestions
fell upon the stony ground of ignorance
even of the most elementary facts of
heredity. The subject was raised again in his
"Inquiries into the Human Faculty" in 1883,
and the word "Eugenics" was then coined.
The ground was still non-receptive.</p>

<p>Then followed a period of rapid increase in
our knowledge of heredity in animals and
plants and in 1901 Galton returned again to
the subject, this time in a more direct and elaborate
way, and his Huxley Lecture of that year
before the Anthropological Institute was upon
"The Possible Improvement of the Human
Breed under the Existing Conditions of Law
and Sentiment." This time he received a real
hearing, partly on account of recent disclosures
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
regarding the state of human society and its
trends in Great Britain, chiefly because there
was at last a real scientific basis for such a proposal.
In this lecture, after declaring that the
possibility of human race culture is no longer
to be considered an academical or impractical
problem, Galton proceeded to show that we
have a sufficient biological knowledge of man to
furnish a working basis. We know of man's
variability and heredity&mdash;that some men are
worth more than others in the community, and
that individual traits are also family possessions.
This he followed up with definite suggestions
as to possible means of the "augmentation
of favored stock."</p>

<p>The then recently organized Sociological Society
of London took up the subject enthusiastically,
and in 1904 and 1905 Galton was invited
to deliver addresses before the Society
upon this topic. In his first address he spoke
upon "Eugenics: its Definition, Scope, and
Aims." This proved to be a statement of the
elementary principles of the subject&mdash;a sort of
eugenic creed. Here Galton struck fire. The
reading of his paper was followed by very extended
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
discussion and criticism, and he received
some enthusiastic support. A few of these enthusiastic
supporters brought forth, on the spur
of the moment, wonderful, visionary schemes
for eugenic progress; much of the adverse criticism
went wide of the mark; and, on the whole,
Galton must have felt that at least he had demonstrated
fully one need for which he had
spoken, that of developing a race of able thinkers.
Galton's second address before the same
society the year following was partly directed
at some of this hasty criticism and partly devoted
to the setting forth of the possibly ultimate
place of the ideals of race improvement
in the conscience of the community, and to
showing how the whole subject is fraught with
"the greatest spiritual dignity and the utmost
social importance."</p>

<p>The subject was now fairly launched. Magazine
articles appeared on "The New National
Patriotism," "Breeding Better Men," <i>et cetera</i>.
Meanwhile the bio-sociologist settled down to
work. And during the five years that have
since passed an immense amount of knowledge
has been gained, and a large number of excellent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
workers recruited. Interest in the subject
is now general, and its importance recognized
as vital. Karl Pearson, known as a good
fighter, is Galton's "beak and claws," performing
for him much the same kind of service that
Huxley performed for Darwin nearly fifty
years ago. Galton himself has established a
Eugenics Laboratory under the direction of
Professor Pearson in the Biometric Laboratory
of the University of London and has
endowed a Research Fellowship and Research
Scholarships. This laboratory is publishing
a series of Memoirs and a series of Lectures
upon eugenic topics. The University
of London is publishing, with the assistance
of the Drapers' Company, a series of "Studies
in National Deterioration." A periodical,
<i>The Eugenics Review</i>, is established
and appearing regularly. A Eugenics Education
Society has been founded to popularize
and disseminate the technical information contained
in the memoirs and special papers.
England remains the seat of greatest activity
and interest, but much is being done now in
this country. In America the subject is largely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
under the auspices of the American Breeders
Association, which has organized an extremely
efficient Committee on Eugenics with which a
large number of biological and medical workers
are co&ouml;perating. This committee has co&ouml;perated
in the establishment of a Eugenics Record
Office, at Cold Spring Harbor, under the direction
of H. H. Laughlin. Relevant facts are
beginning to pour in from many directions;
eugenic ideals are being given practical expression,
and the science is rapidly gaining
headway.</p>

<p>It may be asked: "Well, what is it all about;
are we as a nation not doing well&mdash;well
enough?" Is it not true, as some have suggested,
that this eugenic movement is but one
more expression of England's temporary national
hysteria transferred to this country? In
answer to such queries let us state some of the
conditions which have suggested to so many
sober thinkers and observers that the time is
arriving, has in fact arrived, when we must
begin to think of the future of our communities
and nations and of our race, rather than
contentedly to read of and meditate upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
great achievements of our past, or to parade
with self-satisfied air through our glass houses
of Anglo-Saxon supremacy. Even were we
unthreatened, were we amply holding our own,
the mere fact of the possibility of a natural increase
of human capacity would make it a practical
subject of the utmost importance. We
may be sure that somewhere a nation will avail
itself of such a possibility as the increase of
inherent native talent, physical, mental, moral,
and will tend to become a strong and dominant
people. Why should not <i>we</i> be that
people?</p>

<p>It seems that the facts that lead us to think
of the future in this matter are of two quite distinct
classes. First, we have a great mass of
data relative to the composition of our societies
and to the changing character of our population,
social data of deep significance when
broadly viewed and thoughtfully considered.
Second, there are certain biological considerations,
which all apart from existing social conditions
should warn us to be on the lookout.
First let us review briefly some of the latter,
some of those biological considerations which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
lead us to regard thoughtfully the problem
of the future evolution of man and his societies.</p>

<p>As with other species of animals, each of us
comes into the world equipped with a physical
constitution and a few simple fundamental instincts.
But unlike all other animals, the possession
of these alone does not enable us to take
and maintain our positions in the community
life. Man's life to-day is subject to a great
social heritage which, unlike his natural heritage,
can be realized only as a result of his own
activity and acquisition. Civilized man is the
result of Nature plus Nurture. Civilization
has been defined as "the sum of human contrivances
which enable human beings to advance
independently of heredity." The knowledge of
fact, historic and scientific, of literature, of art,
of custom, and manner, and all that goes to
make up the culture and education which are
the distinctive traits of our human lives&mdash;all
this is no possession of ours when we make our
first bow to society. Nor do these things become
ours through a simple process of growth
and development while we remain the passive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
subjects. All of these things represent
the active individual acquirement of the racial
accumulation of tradition and learning&mdash;what
the biologist would call the results
of modification. Our troubles begin when
we realize that in the acquisition of this load
each generation does not begin where the
preceding left off, not at all&mdash;but we begin
where our parents did. The first thing we do
toward advancing our places in the world is
to absorb what we can of the same kind of thing
our forbears absorbed, learn over again their
lessons, repeat their experiences; and then we
proceed straightway to increase the difficulties
for the next generation by writing more books,
discovering more facts, making a little more
history, and so it goes: the load of tradition
increases with every successive generation, and
so it has gone since the beginning of man's civilization.
It is declared that the modern
schoolboy knows more than did Aristotle. We
cannot resist the inquiry, Has the modern
schoolboy better native ability than had Aristotle?
Here is the whole point of this matter;
are we any better endowed mentally now that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the amount to be mentally absorbed and accomplished
is so many times greater? Has our
capacity for mental accumulation kept pace
with the amount to be accumulated, and with
the necessity for such accumulation as a fitting
for human life of the civilized variety?</p>

<p>Madison Bentley has recently put it nicely in
this way. Does talent grow with knowledge?
"May we not suppose that the men and women
of some distant glacial age, who dwelt upon the
ice, wore the skin of the seal, and ate raw fish,
had as much brain and as generous a measure
of talent as have their remote descendants who
wear sealskins, and eat ices and caviar?" He
continues that we have little or nothing to show
that the hereditary or innate growth of the
mind has kept pace with the growing social
heritage; that as regards mental endowment we
begin where our distant ancestors began. The
chief difference between us and them is that we
proceed at once to burden ourselves with information
and obligation which for them did
not exist. To compass our languages, sciences,
histories, arts, the complicated social, political,
moral r&eacute;gime, we are supplied with virtually
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the same minds that primitive man used for his
primitive needs. Is it any wonder, he asks,
that "education" is the central problem for
our or any other advanced civilization?</p>

<p>The biologist asks whether it is not high time
to look beyond this artificial bolster of education,
to the possibility of actual improvement
of the innate mental abilities of man. The student
of heredity and evolution looking at this
problem has two contributions to make. First,
if the mental capabilities of the present race are
too limited, increase them; if our minds are
too weak to carry the burdens which now must
be carried, do not give up the task&mdash;strengthen
the racial mind. Second, if we should seem to
be in danger of developing a stock which is well
fitted and able to carry the load of mental acquirement
and to push on intellectually, but
which is at the same time physically deficient,
weak, or sterile, or susceptible to disease, do
not let the intellectual capabilities diminish, but
build up the physical constitution to a higher
supporting level. These are not idle suggestions
nor whimsical schemes. The biologist
makes them knowing that these things are possible;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
not only possible, they must be accomplished.
We are foolishly building our civilization
in the form of an inverted pyramid of
individually acquired characteristics. This
structure can be made stable only by supplying
a broader basis of innate ability which can
safely carry the load. This is the first biological
warning to sociology.</p>

<p>The second warning we may put in the form
in which Ray Lankester in his "Kingdom of
Man" has recently presented it so strikingly
and which we may abstract freely and with
some interpolation. "In Nature's struggle for
existence, death ... is the fate of the vanquished,
while the only reward to the victors
... is the permission to reproduce their kind&mdash;to
carry on by heredity to another generation,
the specific qualities by which they triumphed."
The <i>origin</i> of man, partly, at any
rate, by such a process of natural selection, is
one chapter in his history. Another begins
with the development of his mental qualities,
which are of such unprecedented power in Nature.
These qualities so dominate all else in his
"living" activities that they largely cut him
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
off from the general operations of natural selection.
Perhaps the only direction in which
natural selection is the chiefly operative factor
in human evolution to-day is in the development
of immunity from infectious disease. Just
as man is a new departure in the unfolding
scheme of the world, so his presence and characteristics
lead to new methods of evolution, of
survival, and the like. Knowledge, reason, self-consciousness,
will, are new processes in Nature,
and it is these which have largely determined
the direction of man's history. Nature's
discipline of death is more or less successfully
resisted by the will of man. Man is Nature's
Rebel. "Where Nature says 'Die'! Man says
'I will live.'" By his wits and his will man has
overcome many of Nature's bounds and difficulties
without changing, as other organisms
would, his innate characteristics. Not only this
but man has obtained control of his surroundings
and at every step of his development he
has receded farther from the rule of Nature.
Now "he has advanced so far and become so
unfitted to the earlier rule, that to suppose that
Man can 'return to Nature' is as unreasonable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
as to suppose that an adult animal can return
to its mother's womb."</p>

<p>But at present man puts into operation no
real substitute for natural selection. "The
standard raised by the rebel man is not that of
fitness to the conditions proffered by extra-human
Nature, but is one of ideal comfort, prosperity,
and conscious joy of life&mdash;imposed by
the will of man and involving a control, and in
important respects a subversion, of what were
Nature's methods of dealing with life before
she had produced her insurgent son." Progress
in the control of Nature has been going on
with enormous rapidity during the last two centuries
particularly&mdash;the "nature searchers"
have placed almost limitless power in the hands
of men. And yet the builders of society and
governments and nations have failed to profit
by this increase in natural knowledge. In our
social and national organization we remain
fixed in the old paths of ignorance. Lankester
says: "I speak for those who would urge the
conscious and deliberate assumption of his
kingdom by Man&mdash;not as a matter of markets
and of increased opportunity for the cosmopolitan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
dealers in finance&mdash;but as an absolute duty,
the fulfillment of Man's destiny." The purpose
of his essay is "to point out that civilized man
has proceeded so far in his interference with
extra-human Nature, has produced for himself
and for the living organisms associated with
him such a special state of things, by his rebellion
against natural selection and his defiance
of pre-human dispositions, that he must either
go on and acquire firmer control of the conditions,
or perish miserably by the vengeance certain
to fall on the half-hearted meddler in great
affairs." Man is a fighting rebel who at every
forward step lays himself open to the liabilities
of greater penalties should his attack
prove unsuccessful. Moreover, while emancipating
himself from the destructive and progressive
methods of Nature, man has accumulated
a new series of dangers and difficulties
with which he must incessantly contend and
which he must finally control. Man has taken
a tremendous step&mdash;created desperate conditions
by the exercise of his will&mdash;further control
is essential in order that he should escape
from final misery and destruction.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Nor is this idle, academic invective. The biologist
knows that this is true. It is not idle, for man
has the means at his command&mdash;it is
merely a question of their employment. This,
then, is the second biological warning to sociology
and to statecraft.</p>

<p>Now we may return to consider briefly the
nature of those social data which we suggested
force us to think seriously of the problem of man's
future.</p>

<p>As a primary datum we may note the increasing
population of the countries of Europe
and North America (Fig. 1). The countries
whose population is increasing most rapidly
are the United States, Russia, and the German
Empire. We know that one important factor
of the increase in this country is that of immigration,
but this is not sufficient to account for
the total. There is continued multiplication
of the native population, and of the immigrant
after he is here. We wish only to point out in
connection with this diagram the steady trend
of the population upward, and the fact that obviously
somewhere there must be a limit. This
cannot go on without end.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
An extremely pertinent fact here has been
disclosed by Pearson and is based upon very
extensive observations among several different
classes and nations. It is this&mdash;that one fourth
of the married population of the present generation
produce one half of the next generation.
The death rate and the ratio of unmarried to
married being what they are, this relation may
be stated in this way&mdash;twelve per cent of all
the individuals born in the last generation produced
one half of the present generation.
"This is not only a general law, but it is practically
true for each class in the community."
This conclusion is based upon data from the
English, Danish, and Welsh peoples of professional,
domestic, commercial, industrial, and
pastoral classes, and the per cent of married
persons found to be producing one half of each
generation varies from twenty-three to twenty-seven
with an average of twenty-five per cent.
We must ask at once&mdash;what is the source of this
fourth which is contributing double its quota
to the next generation? Is this twenty-five
per cent drawn proportionately from all classes
of society or are some groups contributing relatively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
more than others? Is there any relation
between this superfertility and the possession
of desirable or undesirable characteristics?
We may answer at once&mdash;there is a distinct and
positive relation between civic undesirability
and high fertility. We shall return to this
subject at the close of the next chapter; only
the bare fact is to be mentioned at this time.</p>

<p>It is a matter of common notice and remark
that to-day, in England at any rate, there is a
dearth of youthful ability. It exists in commerce,
science, literature, politics, the bar, the
church. We cannot dismiss as merely fashionable
the statements that the able classes are not
replacing themselves, that men of ability are
less able than formerly. Whether or not this
is also the condition in America to-day, we
know that it soon will be the condition unless
steps are taken to bring about a positive relation
between civic desirability and ability and
the numerical production of offspring.</p>

<p>Let us turn to data of a somewhat different
kind. The United States Census Reports for
the decades from 1850 to 1900 (1904) include
data relative to the number of prisoners in this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
country. The returns for 1904 omitted certain
classes previously enumerated so that for comparative
purposes the figures given have to be
corrected. On the corrected basis these reports
show that the total number of prisoners in the
United States increased from 6,737 in 1850 to
about 100,000 in 1904, while the total population
increased during the same time only from
twenty-three to eighty millions (Fig. 2). The
ratio of prisoners to the total population is
of course the significant relation here, and
this increased from 29 per 100,000 in 1850 to
125 per 100,000 in 1904. Not all of this increase
can be attributed to more rigid enforcement of
the law or raised standards of morality; there
is some reason for thinking that whatever
change there has been in these respects has
tended to have the opposite effect. We should
note, in considering such data as these, that the
penologist generally assumes that of the total
number of offenders, actually only about ten
per cent are in prison at any one time.</p>

<p>During the last century, in France, many
parts of Germany, and in Spain the increase in
criminality was terrifying. In the United States
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the number of murders and homicides per million
of the entire population has nearly trebled
in the last fifteen years (Fig. 2). The average
for the five years from 1885 to 1889 inclusive
was 38.5 per million, and for the five years
from 1902 to 1906 it became 110 per million.</p>

United States from 1850 to 1904.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
England's "defective" classes during the 22
years between 1874 and 1896 increased from
5.4 to 11.6 per thousand of the total; that is,
more than doubled in that brief period. Rentoul
has collected careful information regarding
the number of insane or mentally defective
and degenerate in Great Britain. In England
the number of "officially certified" insane,
which is far less than the actual number, increased
from one to every 319 of the total
population, to one to 285, in the nine years preceding
1905. In Ireland comparison of the
years 1851 and 1896&mdash;a period of 45 years intervening&mdash;shows
an increase in the corresponding
ratio from 1:657 to 1:178. The census
of 1901 showed in Great Britain 484,507 mental
defectives of all kinds; this is one to 85 of the
total population, and probably if the whole
truth were known the ratio would approximate
1:50, according to Rentoul's calculation. The
ratio of known insane just doubled in the decade
preceding 1901. The Scottish Commission
reports an increase in insane of 190 per cent
since 1858, the total population increasing
meanwhile by only 52 per cent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
The worst side of these British statistics follows.
In 1901, of the 60,000 and more, idiots,
imbeciles, and feeble-minded, nearly 19,000&mdash;roughly
one third&mdash;were married and free to
multiply; and as for that matter a great many
of those unmarried are known to have been
prolific. In 1901, of the 117,000 lunatics, nearly
47,000&mdash;considerably more than one third&mdash;were
married. 65,700 idiots and lunatics legally
multiplying their kind and worse! Rentoul
rightly says: "The hand that wrecks the cradle
wrecks the nation."</p>

<p>In the United States the census of 1880 reported
40,942 insane in hospitals, and 51,017
not in hospitals&mdash;a total of 91,959 known insane.
In 1903 the number in hospitals had increased
to 150,151. The number not in hospitals was
not given and cannot be determined accurately,
but it is conservatively estimated as certainly
not less than 30,000, and probably it is far
greater than this. In many states it is known
that about one fourth of the insane are not in
hospitals. But taking the total of 180,000 as a
conservative figure, the ratio of known insane
in the total population was 225 per 100,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
in 1903 as compared with 183 per 100,000 in
1880.</p>

<p>The methods of the collection of such data
vary in different countries so that the results
are not comparable. In a single country there
is less, though still some, lack of uniformity, so
that the exact rate of increase in the ratio of
the insane is still somewhat doubtful. Moreover,
it is doubtless true that some of this apparent
increase results from improved methods
in the collection of data, and from more complete
registration of these defectives. But suppose
we disregard entirely the idea of an increase
in the ratio of these defectives, the bare
fact of the existence of nearly 200,000 insane
in this country is sufficiently alarming; and it
is disgraceful to any nation, because it is unnecessary.
The Superintendent of the Ohio Institution
for the Feeble Minded wrote in 1902:
"Unless preventive measures against the progressive
increase of the defective classes are
adopted, such a calamity as the gradual eclipse,
slow decay and final disintegration of our present
form of society and government is not only
possible, but probable."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
The latest census reports for the United
States give data relative to the dependents and
defectives in institutions. The numbers not
in institutions can only be guessed at. But
from the available sources we can gain an approximate
conception of the numbers in our
country to-day as follows:&mdash;insane and feeble
minded, at least 200,000; blind, 100,000; deaf,
and deaf and dumb, 100,000; paupers in institutions,
80,000, two thirds of whom have
children, and are also physically or mentally
deficient, and to say that one half of the whole
number of paupers are in institutions is to give
a ridiculously low estimate; prisoners, 100,000,
and several hundred thousand more that should
be prisoners; juvenile delinquents, 23,000 in institutions;
the number cared for by hospitals,
dispensaries, "homes" of various kinds, in the
year 1904 was in excess of 2,000,000. From
these figures we get a rough total of nearly
3,000,000. Must we define a civilized and enlightened
nation as one in which only one person
in every thirty can be classed as defective
or dependent?</p>

<p>It is needless to continue descriptions of this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
kind. The foregoing are representative data;
they are published by the volume. It is always
the same story&mdash;rapid increase of the unfit, defective,
insane, criminal; slow increase, even
decrease of the fit, normal, or gifted stocks. It
is with such conditions in mind that Whetham
writes: "Although this suppression of the best
blood of the country is a new disease in modern
Europe, it is an old story in the history of nations
and has been the prelude to the ruin of
states and the decline and fall of empires."</p>

<p>The ultimate aim of Sociology is doubtless
the working out of the laws according to which
stable communities are formed and maintained,
and in which each component individual may
enjoy and contribute the maximum of pleasure
and profit. So the primary purpose of Statecraft
is to produce a nation which shall be stable
and enduring. This is all familiar ground.
The objects of the nation's immediate activities
and concern, protection from enemy, development
of commerce and manufacture, agriculture,
and education, all these are for the real
purpose of establishing and promoting national
integrity. No nation exists long without ideals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and traditions, without teachers, artists, poets,
and yet the primary condition of the existence of
all these is a great body of citizens characterized
by physical and mental soundness&mdash;vigor
and sanity. In searching for guiding principles
in their great endeavors the sociologist
and statesman have sought aid from many
sources. But, as Pearson points out, Philosophy
has thus far given no law by the aid of
which we can understand how a nation becomes
physically and mentally vigorous. Anthropology
has done little to show wherein exists human
fitness as a social organism. Political
Economists object that they are not listened to
with respectful consideration in legislative
chambers. History is the favorite hunting
ground of the statesman searching for guidance;
but unfortunately history teaches chiefly
by example and analogy, rarely by true explanation.
And just as some gifted persons are able
to give an apt Biblical quotation touching any
occurrence whatever, so, many statesmen can
cite some historical analogue which they offer
as evidence for their views, whatever they are.
These men are sincere, in their ignorance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
nature of scientific proof. Finally, although
the Statesman still holds rather aloof, the Sociologist
comes now to the Biologist, inquiring
whether by any chance he may be in possession
of data or guiding principles which may be
somehow of service in the building of stable
societies. The Biologist does not send him
away without contribution. The Sociologist
makes known his needs, the Biologist displays
his possessions, and it is at once evident to both
that they have much in common, and that each
is able to supply the other with some needed
wares. Each may learn from the other; and
best of all, the Biologist seems to have information
which can be of the greatest service in their
common work of building sound societies.</p>

<p>And the biologist is grateful to the sociologist
for reminding him that he, too, has sacred
duties in this direction. He is too often forgetful
that the real aim of his own, as of any science,
is to be useful in real human life. It is
pleasing to the biologist to feel that he is at last
in possession of facts of value to the student
of human society, for to him his debt is great.
From the sociologist he has drawn the inspirations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
which have led to some of his greatest discoveries.
It was Malthus who suggested to
Darwin the great principle of the struggle for
existence among men which Darwin so successfully
applied to other organisms, and used so
profitably in building up his great theory of
natural selection. It was from the sociologist
that the biologist derived his idea of the physiological
division of labor which has proved
so fruitful a conception; and from the same
source he has drawn many of his conceptions
of organic individuality.</p>

<p>We might suggest here some of the topics
upon which biology has information of value
in this bio-social field; many of these we shall
discuss later on from our present and special
point of view. First of all come the facts regarding
the variability and variation of human
beings, not alone in physical characteristics, but
in respect to psychic traits as well. Here as in
all organisms we must distinguish between true
variations and bodily modifications; that is, we
must be careful to make, as far as possible, the
biological distinction between innate and acquired
traits, particularly in considering mental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
characteristics. Next must come consideration
of the facts of heredity. This is undoubtedly
the field of greatest importance to the
Eugenist; facts of no other kind are of equal
significance in determining the course of eugenic
practice. We now have a fairly extensive
working basis here from which to discuss heredity
in man. The various phases of human selection
should be noticed, in particular that
known as selective fertility or differential fertility
in different social groups or classes. Another
evolutionary factor of importance here
is that of "isolation" in the many and varied
forms which it assumes in human society, especially
those which result from assortative and
preferential mating, and from the operation
of social convention, restrictions in marriage,
and the like.</p>

<p>Before discussing any of these subjects let us
offer here just a word of caution to the enthusiast.
The results gained in one field of science
cannot be transferred <i>in toto</i> to another field
and there be found to fit. Biology has learned
much from Physics and Chemistry, but the biological
applications of the laws of these sciences
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
must be carried out with the greatest
care. Such transference has often been premature
and attended by results retardative to
progress in the field of Biology. Any formula
borrowed from one science and applied in another
must be rigorously tested under the new
conditions. The indiscriminating application
of biological laws in the field of sociology may
result in confusion and retardation in the progress
of both sciences, or at any rate in their
practical applications. As Thomson points out
in writing on this topic, human society is not
only a complex of individual activities of a
strictly biological character, but also and further
it involves an integration and regulation
of those activities which are not yet, at least,
susceptible of concrete biological analysis.
Thomson says: "The biological ideal of a
healthful, self-sustaining, evolving human
breed is as fundamental as the social ideal of a
harmoniously integrated society is supreme."
The great danger here lies in forgetting the
fundamental and general character of the biological
principles. The ideals of biology and
sociology need not coincide, often they do not,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
but they must not conflict. In practice Eugenics
must be largely a social matter; but in its
theory, its fundamentals, it must be largely biological.</p>

<p>The coming together of biology and sociology,
and their common search for guiding principles
in their common endeavor is likely to
have results of several kinds. It is likely to
bring out more clearly than has yet been done
the distinction, in human life and society, between
that which is fundamentally biological
or animal, and that which is distinctly social.
Such information will prove of especial value
later when the time comes for the suggestion
and carrying out of a definite eugenic program,
when the time comes for the real eugenic organization
of society. And further the close
<i>rapprochement</i> of the two subjects will doubtless
result in mutual aid and suggestion in the
development of each subject in its own stricter
field, outside the limits of their common meeting
ground.</p>

<p>Before bringing this introductory chapter
to a conclusion we should suggest one further
caution which must be borne in mind. There
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
may at times seem to be suggestions of antagonism
between the biological and the social conceptions
of what is eugenic and what is not.
Much of this apparent discord will disappear
if we recognize that after all the overlapping
areas of the two subjects which have fused into
the subject of Eugenics are relatively small
portions of either whole subject. Sociology has
for one of its aims, perhaps its chief aim, the
improvement of the present condition of society.
The sociologist is interested in the
improvement of social conditions to-day and
to-morrow. He wants to improve housing conditions,
food and milk supplies, to reduce the
curses of alcoholism, poverty, and crime, to
take the children out of the factory and their
mothers out of the sweatshop and put them
into schools or under humane conditions of
labor. And so on through a long list. The biologist
or Eugenist is of course heartily with the
sociologist in these endeavors, but as a human
being, not as a biologist or Eugenist. For the
Eugenist is, as such, by deliberate assumption
and definition, directly interested in only such
conditions as affect the innate characteristics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the race, conditions which may not have direct
reference to the present generation at all,
but to the next and to future generations. As
a Eugenist he is not concerned with factory
legislation, alcoholism, or play grounds, unless
it can be shown that there is a relation between
these things and the innate mental and physical
properties of the race. If there is such a
relation, of improvement or impairment, these
are eugenic topics; if there is no such relation
they are purely social topics, and the Eugenist
does not deal with them, not because they are
not worth dealing with, but because they are
then by definition outside his field. In the end
the Eugenist hopes, with the Sociologist, to accomplish
these social betterments, but he believes
that these will come as by-products in the
process of innate racial improvement&mdash;improvement
in the inherent, physical, mental, and moral
qualities of the human kind, and that accomplished
in this way the results will be more
stable and permanent than any accomplished by
attacking the problems as such and separately,
largely leaving out of account the real and
fundamental cause&mdash;bad human protoplasm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Eugenics is not offered as a universal cure
for social ills: no single cure exists. But
the Eugenist believes that no other single factor
in determining social conditions and practices
approaches in importance that of racial
structural integrity and sanity. The Eugenist
would oppose only those social activities, if
such there be, that conflict with his ideal of
genuine, progressive, human evolution. The
main question which the Eugenist would raise
here is largely that of the economy of effort&mdash;whether
it were not better by concentrating
upon a few activities, known to give permanent
results, once for all to end an intolerable social
condition, rather than to attempt the Sisyphean
task.</p>

<p>In conclusion let us quote a few sentences
from Francis Galton. "Charity refers to the
individual; Statesmanship to the nation; Eugenics
cares for both.... I take Eugenics
very seriously, feeling that its principles ought
to become one of the dominant motives in a civilized
nation, much as if they were one of its
religious tenets.... Man is gifted with pity
and other kindly feelings; he has also the power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
of preventing many kinds of suffering. I conceive
it to fall well within his province to replace
Natural Selection by other processes that
are more merciful and not less effective. This
is precisely the aim of Eugenics. Its first
object is to check the birth rate of the Unfit instead
of allowing them to come into being,
though doomed in large numbers to perish prematurely.
The second object is the improvement
of the race by furthering the productivity
of the Fit, by early marriages and the healthful
rearing of their children. Natural Selection
rests upon excessive production and wholesale
destruction; Eugenics on bringing no more individuals
into the world than can be properly
cared for, and those only of the best stock."</p>

<h3>THE BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATIONS OF EUGENICS</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records
reach, is in you this hour,..."</p></div>


<p>We must now proceed to consider
briefly and with only the necessary
detail the modes of application of
certain biological principles and data in this
special field of Eugenics. First of all a clear
understanding of the basic ideas of variability
and heredity must be had as a primary condition
of an appreciation of their significance
for the subject before us.</p>

<p>Like any other organism a human being is
a bundle of characteristics, physical and psychical.
Each person has a definite stature and
span, possesses fingers and toes, a head, eyes,
ears, hair of a certain color, and so on through
a long list of physical traits. Physiological
characteristics has he also, such as muscular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
strength, resistance to fatigue or to disease of
many kinds, digestive and assimilative powers,
a rate of heart beat, a blood pressure, an habitual
gait, posture, a characteristic way of
clasping the hands or of twirling the thumbs&mdash;and
so almost <i>ad infinitum</i>. He also possesses
certain physiological traits more closely related
with the action of the central nervous
system&mdash;keenness of vision, or hearing, or
smell, memory, vivacity, cheerfulness, self-assertiveness,
self-consciousness, reasoning power,
determination, and the like.</p>

<p>There is a period during the existence of each
human being when he does not seem to possess
these traits or anything resembling them. For
at the beginning of his existence as a new and
separate creature, every individual, among the
groups of higher organisms, has the form of a
single organic cell&mdash;the germ. This germ may
be, as it is in man, of microscopic dimensions,
and it always shows a comparatively slight degree
of differentiation of structure. Moreover,
the parts and organs of the germ bear no actual
or visible resemblance at all to the organs
and parts of the organism into which the germ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
rapidly develops. In other words, in the germ
of an organism we have a structure, partly material,
partly dynamic, the components of which
in some way represent the adult characteristics
without resembling them. During the period
of the development of the individual, that is to
say, during its "ontogeny," these characteristics
of the germ become expressed in their final
or adult form.</p>

<p>For our purpose it is not necessary to inquire
precisely how it is that the structure of the
germ can thus represent or determine the structures
growing out of it. It must suffice to see
that somehow the characteristics of the germ
lead to the formation or development of other
characters, and these in turn to still others until
at last a period of comparative changelessness
is reached, when we say that development is
completed. It is important to recognize, however,
that this development is fundamentally
a process of reaction, the reaction between
the germ and its surrounding conditions. The
characteristics of the adult organism are <i>determined</i>
primarily by the structure of the
germ; they <i>appear</i> gradually and successively,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
as the growing organism reacts to its environing
conditions.</p>

<p>An adult organism is continually doing certain
things&mdash;performing certain movements,
producing certain secretions, undergoing a
great variety of physical and chemical changes.
Just what the organism does at any given moment
is in reality determined by two groups of
factors: first, it depends, obviously, upon the
structure of the organism acting, upon the organs
it has to act with, and upon the precise
condition of these organs and of the whole
individual; and second, it depends upon the
nature of those conditions outside of and affecting
the organism which lead it to act at all.
Either group of factors taken alone will not
lead to any activity; activity of an organism
must be a reaction between organismal structure
and environing conditions&mdash;an irritable
substance and stimuli to activity. And the
character or quality of an act is affected by
circumstances within either set of factors.</p>

<p>In much the same way the germ acts, and
its action is similarly a reaction between the
structure of the germ and its environing conditions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
The germ reacts by producing certain
parts, differentiating certain structures, in
short, by developing. The normal activities or
reactions of the adult organism we call in general
its "behavior." The normal activities or
reactions of the germ and embryo we call "development";
the normal behavior of the germ
is development. And in the latter, as well as
in the former, changes in either set of factors
lead to changes in the nature of the result of
their interaction, i. e., to changes in the characteristics
actually appearing as the result of development.</p>

<p>In their fully developed state some of the
traits or characteristics of organisms are single,
simple, fundamental characters, not analyzable
into more elementary factors. Such
are the number of fingers, or of joints in the
fingers, absence of pigments of several kinds
from the eyes or hair, presence of cataract, <i>et
cetera</i>. These so-called "unit characters" are
roughly analogous to the chemical elements
which may, as units, be combined and recombined
in diverse ways, but which always maintain
their integrity as elements although different
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
combinations produce wholes that are
unlike. Each unit character in the adult is the
result of a series of reactions between the environing
conditions of development and a
germinal structural unit, as yet hypothetical
and provisionally called the "determiner,"
which in some way not yet understood represents
this adult trait.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are many of these
things which we call characteristics which seem
to be composite, capable of being analyzed or
factored into a group of simpler components
or unit characters. Such apparently are stature,
span, resistance to fatigue, and probably
most psychic traits. Each of these complexes
results apparently from a series of reactions
between the conditions of development and a
group of hypothetical germinal determiners
that tend to be associated within the germ.</p>

<p>The presence or absence of a determiner in
a germ is thus the primary cause of the corresponding
presence or absence of a certain
characteristic in the adult organism.</p>

<p>But whatever the essential nature of the
characteristic in this respect, whether simple
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
or complex, we know further that every organismal
characteristic is subject to variation. In
any group of human individuals, for example,
we can find persons of different stature, different
weight, with fingers of different length
and form, with heads of different size and
shape, hair and eyes of different shades, different
blood pressures, pulse rates, digestive
possibilities, different degrees of determination,
cheerfulness, alertness, and so forth. This
fact of variation is not limited to the comparison
of the individuals of a given group or
generation among themselves, but successive
generations considered as the units of comparison
show the same sort of thing. And
further successive broods from the same parents
exhibit this same phenomenon of variation
when compared with one another. Variation
is a universal fact&mdash;not only among organic
things but in the inorganic world as well. The
variation which any company of persons shows
in stature is paralleled by the variation in the
diameter of the grains in a handful of sand,
or of the drops in a rainstorm.</p>

<p>When we examine the phenomena of variation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
carefully we find that they are of two quite
distinct categories. The first kind of variation,
that which we most frequently think of as
"variation," should properly be termed <i>variability</i>.
Differences of this type are small
<i>fluctuations</i> in any and every character, centering
about an average or mean, which is itself
fairly definite and fixed&mdash;less subject to variation
in different groups or through successive
generations. For example, if we measure by
inches the stature of a thousand or more persons
chosen at random we find that they may
vary from fifty-four to seventy-six inches; the
most frequent heights might be about sixty-nine
and sixty-four inches among the men and
women respectively. The results of such a
measurement may be expressed graphically as
in Figure 3, which is an expression of the measurement
of 1,052 mothers. The measurement
of almost any characteristic in a large group
of any organisms usually gives a result of the
kind figured. The most significant fact here is
that this normal variability exhibited by the
traits of living organisms follows closely the
laws of chance or probability. That is to say,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
the number of individuals occurring in any
class which has a certain deviation above or
below the average, is directly related to, or
dependent upon (in mathematical terms, "is a
function of"), the extent of the deviation of
the value of that class from the average of the
whole group. The significance of this is that
the precise fluctuation which we find in any
individual is the result of the operation of a
large number of causes or factors, each contributing
slightly and variably to the total
result.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/fig3.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 3." title="Fig. 3." />
<p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Recorded measurements of the stature of 1,052
mothers. The height of each rectangle is proportional to the number of
individuals of each given height. The curve connecting the tops of the
rectangles is the normal frequency curve. The most frequent height is
between 62 and 63 inches. Average height&mdash;62.5 inches. Standard
deviation, 2.39 inches. Coefficient of variability, 3.8 (2.39=3.8+ %
of 62.5 inches). (From Pearson.)</span></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Many of the most important facts about
variability can be illustrated by a simple model
such as that suggested by Galton. This is a
modification of the familiar bagatelle board,
covered with glass and arranged as shown in
Fig. 4. A funnel-shaped container at the top
of the board is filled with peas or similar objects
(Fig. 4, <i>A</i>). Below this is a regular
series of obstacles symmetrically arranged, and
below these, at the bottom of the board, is a
row of vertical compartments also arranged
symmetrically with reference to the chief axis
of the whole system. If we allow the peas
to escape from the bottom of the container
and to fall among the obstacles into the compartments
below we find that their distribution
there follows certain laws capable of precise
mathematical description, so that it might be
predicted with fair accuracy (Fig. 4, <i>B</i>). The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
middle compartment will receive the most;
the compartments next the middle somewhat
fewer; those farther from the middle still
fewer; and the end compartments fewest. If
we connect the top of each column of peas by
a curved line we get just such a curve as
that given by the stature measurements above
(Fig. 3), i. e., the normal frequency curve. A
curve of the same essential character would result
from plotting the dimensions of a thousand
cobblestones, the deviations from the bull's-eye
in a target-shooting contest, or by plotting
the variability of any organismal character&mdash;whether
it be the stature or strength of men,
the spread of sparrows' wings, the number of
rays on scallop shells, or of ray-flowers of
daisies.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">
<img src="images/fig4.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 4." title="Fig. 4." />
<p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span>&mdash;Model to illustrate the law of probability or "chance." Description in the text.
<i>A</i>, Peas held in container at top of board. <i>B</i>, Peas after having fallen through the obstructions
into the vertical compartments below. The curve connecting the tops of the columns of
peas is the normal probability curve.</span></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
With this model we may illustrate many
other essential facts about variability which
must be borne in mind when approaching the
problems of Eugenics. Before we allow the
peas to fall we know quite definitely what the
general distribution of them all will be, but we
do not know at all the future position of any
single pea. Of this we can speak only in terms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of probability; the chances are very high that
it will fall in one of the three middle compartments,
very low that it will be in one of the extreme
compartments. But the chances are
equal, whatever they are, that it will fall above
or below the average or middle position. We
see then that in any group there are many more
individuals near the average, i. e., mediocre,
than there are in the classes removed from the
average and the farther the remove of a class
from the average the smaller the number of
individuals in that class. Yet all the individuals
belong to the same whole group. This
leads to the very important fact that <i>an individual
may belong to a group without representing
it fairly</i>. The average individuals are
the most representative. But in order to get a
correct idea of the whole group we must know,
first, to what <i>extent</i> deviations occur in each
direction, above and below the group average,
and, second, the average <i>amount</i> by which each
individual of the group deviates from this
group average. That is, we must know the
amount of variability as well as the extent of
the greatest divergence from the average. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
best measure of the amount of variability exhibited
by any group of objects or organisms
is not the simple average or mean of all the
individual deviations from the average of the
group; it is the square root of the mean squared
deviations from the group average. This is
called the <i>index</i> of variability or "standard
deviation." In order to make possible the comparison
of the variabilities of characteristics
measured in unlike units, such as weight and
stature, this index must be converted into an
equivalent abstract quantity. This is done by
reducing the index of variability to per cents
of the group average, giving what is called the
<i>coefficient</i> of variability. Thus, for example,
in stature the index of variability (standard
deviation) of certain classes of men is approximately
2.7 inches; that is, in a large group of
men the amount of individual variation from
the average height of 69 inches amounts to 2.7
inches. This gives an abstract <i>coefficient</i> of
about 4.0 per cent, for 2.7 equals 3.9 per cent
of 69. Similarly the index of variability of the
weight of a group of university students has
been found to be about 16.5 pounds; the average
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
weight is about 153 pounds, and the coefficient
of variability is therefore about 10.8
per cent (16.5 equals 10.78 per cent of 153).
Although pounds and inches may not be compared,
these two abstract coefficients may be,
and we may say that men are more than twice
as variable in weight as in stature.</p>

<p>Turning now to variation of the second type
we find what are ordinarily called <i>mutations</i>,
or differences quite properly termed <i>variations</i>,
in a strict sense, as distinguished from
the preceding fluctuations or variability phenomena.
Mutations or variations are abrupt
changes of the average or type condition to a
new condition or value which then becomes a
new center of fluctuating variability. The difference
between variability and variation may
be illustrated through an analogy suggested by
Galton (Fig. 5). A polygonal plinth, or better
a polyhedron, resting upon one face is easily
tipped slightly back and forth, but after slight
disturbance it always returns to its first position
of stable equilibrium. Each face of the
plinth or polyhedron represents an organismal
characteristic; these slight backward and forward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
movements represent fluctuations, always
centering about the average condition. An unusually
hard push sends the plinth over upon
another face in which it has a new position of
stability; this represents true variation or
mutation. In this new position it is again
stable, may again be rocked back and forth
showing fluctuations about its new average
position.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/fig5.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 5." title="Fig. 5." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Plinth to illustrate the difference between variability
(fluctuation) and variation (mutation).</span></div>

<p>The essential difference between true variation
and fluctuation or variability of an extreme
nature, is with reference to the inheritance of
such divergence. In the second generation the
offspring of extreme variates or fluctuations
have not the same average as their own parents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
but an average much nearer that of the
whole group to which their parents belonged;
the average stature of the children of unusually
short or tall parents is respectively greater
or less than that of their own parents&mdash;that is,
is nearer the average of the whole group of
parents, provided the shortness or tallness of
the parents is a fluctuation. When the shortness
or tallness is a true variation or mutational
character, offspring have approximately
the same average stature as their immediate
parents, although the children of course show
fluctuation in height so that some are slightly
above and others slightly below the parental
height.</p>

<p>Mutations may occur through the addition or
the subtraction of single characters of the simple
or unit type. Such are the variations from
brown or blue eyes to albino, five fingers to six,
and the like. These are the familiar "sports"
of the horticulturalist and breeder. They are
of the greatest value in evolution, for it seems
quite likely that it is only through the permanent
racial fixation of these mutations that
permanent changes in the characters of a breed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
may be effected, i. e., evolution occurs primarily
through mutation.</p>

<p>In connection with the general subject of
variation we should mention briefly certain
aspects of the recent work of Johannsen and
Jennings, showing that many organic specific
groups or "species," whose characters, when
measured accurately give what is called a normal
variability curve similar to that of stature
illustrated in Fig. 3, are not really homogeneous
groups of fluctuating individuals as the
curves would indicate superficially, but that
each gross group or species is actually composed
of a blend of a number of smaller groups,
each with its own average and fluctuating variability.
It is only when these are taken all
together as a lump that they fuse into a single
and apparently simple curve.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/fig6.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 6." title="Fig. 6." />
<p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span>&mdash;Curves illustrating the relation between the pure
line and the species or other large group. <i>A</i>, a "species" curve
composed of three pure lines. <i>B</i>, the separate elements of the larger
curve each with its own average and variability.</span></p></div>

<p>For example, the curve shown in Fig. 6, A,
which is approximately that of a normal distribution,
in some cases might be shown by
experimentation to consist in reality of several
truly distinct elements, say three for purposes
of illustration, as shown in Fig. 6, B. Each of
these sub-groups has its own average and its
own amount and extent of variability (fluctuation)
and it is only by adding them together
that we get the larger group. Each of these
elementary groups is called a "pure line,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
which is defined as a group of organisms, all
of which are the progeny of a single individual.
The characteristics of each pure line remain
stable through successive generations, each
about its own average; and it is chiefly this
fact that enables us to identify the different
lines. Transition from the condition of one
pure line to another occurs only as a mutation.
At present the theory of the pure line is strictly
applicable only to organisms reproducing asexually
or to self-fertilizing forms where the
group observed is actually composed of the
progeny of a single organism. It is hardly
possible to say as yet whether or not this extremely
important theory is essentially applicable
to the human species or any species where
two organisms are involved in the establishment
of a race or line, but there are some indications
of a circumstantial nature that it is
thus applicable in its essentials and so modified
as to include this fact of biparental inheritance.</p>

<p>With this bare skeleton of the subject of variation
before us let us see how facts of this kind
may have any significance for the subject of
Eugenics, any bearing upon the possibility of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
racial improvement. When any of the varying
human traits, and they all vary, is measured
carefully and the results tabulated we find that
they give us a curve approximating the normal
frequency curve, such as we have described
above and illustrated in Fig. 3. The coefficients
of variability of a great many human traits are
known and a few representative coefficients
are given in Table I. This type of variability
is given then, by measurements of physical
characteristics of all kinds, and, what is of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
greater importance, physiological traits, including
mental and moral characteristics, so far
as they can be measured by present methods,
vary in just the same way. Annual individual
earnings give us a curve closely similar to that
of a normal frequency curve with an approximate
minimum limiting value. Even the tabulation
of citizens according to their social
standing or "civic worth" gives the same sort
of thing. This has been brought out nicely in
Galton's discussion of Booth's classification of
the population of London.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to answer the question whether
mutations or true variations are occurring
frequently in the human species. Usually it is
impossible to distinguish between an extreme
fluctuation and a true variation without experimental
test and the observation of the behavior
of the varying trait through several generations.
In most instances this has been impossible
with human beings. From collateral evidence
it seems quite probable that man is
mutating with considerable frequency, especially
with respect to psychic traits.</p>

<p>The evolution of the race could be directed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
more easily and permanent results attained
more rapidly through taking advantage of valuable
mutations than in any other way. A race
truly desiring to progress would foster carefully
anything resembling mutation in a favorable
direction. As a matter of fact, however,
our social custom leads us to look with disfavor
upon most youthful traits that seem unusual
or out of the ordinary. It would be difficult
to devise a system of "education" which
could more effectively repress than does our
own the development of unusual mental traits.
In this connection "abnormal" or "eccentric"
may often mean a mutation in a profitable
direction, a getting away from the average of
mediocrity in the direction of improvement.</p>

<p>It is clear that we have the raw materials
for race improvement. There are some individuals
with more and some with less than
the average in any respect&mdash;physical, mental,
moral. The average of a whole social group
can be shifted by subtraction at one end or
addition at the other, or more easily and more
effectively by both together. In order to raise
the general average of the value of any of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
traits it is not necessary to strive to exceed the
known maximum value in any respect. The
study of the "pure line," as mentioned above,
shows that this may for a long time remain impossible,
or at any rate difficult, pending the
appearance of a mutation in a favorable direction.
We can, however, raise the general average
of physical strength or of mental or moral
ability by increasing the relative number of
individuals in the upper groups or by diminishing
the number in the lower groups, most easily
of course and most effectively by doing both
of these things. By increasing the numbers
composing the lines which form the upper elements
of a social group we not only add immensely
to the total value of the group but we
do actually change somewhat the general average.
On the other hand numerical increase in the lines in
the lower part of the group will
actually lower the average of the whole, though
it does not actually affect the number of individuals
in the more able and valuable classes.</p>

<p>Another consideration is of great importance
here. The average is affected only slightly by
the change of individuals from class to class
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
near the average. But the shifting of even one
or two per cent of the individuals into or out
of extreme positions has a very marked effect
upon the character of the total group and upon
the average. In the life of the State the character
of the general average of the citizens is
of the greatest importance, and comparatively
small deviations in the average of civic worth
may mean much as regards the history of a
democracy. Of course the average individuals
in a social group may not be those of greatest
influence; even when taken all together they
may not determine the trend of the life of the
society; but that does not alter the essential
fact that the condition of the average of the
population is of very great moment to a democratic
state.</p>

<p>Many of our social endeavors to-day serve in
effect to raise individuals from one of the lower
groups up to or toward the average. Millions
of dollars and an incalculable amount of time
and energy are spent annually in striving to
accomplish this kind of result. How immeasurably
greater would be the benefit to society
if the same amount of energy and money were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
spent in moving individuals from the middle
classes on up toward the higher. In the development
of our societies we need to use every possible
means to carry individuals from positions
near the average to positions above the
average, and the farther this remove is above
the average both in its starting point and its
stopping point, the better for the social group.
Elevation from mediocrity to superiority has
far greater effect upon the social constitution
than has elevation from inferiority to mediocrity.</p>

<p>As the Whethams have written recently: "Of
late years, the duty of the State to support the
falling and fallen has been so much emphasized
that its still more important duty to the able
and competent has been obscured. Yet it is
they who are the real national asset of worth,
and it is essential to secure that their action
should not be hampered, and their value sterilized,
by the jealousy and obstruction of the
social failures, and of others whom pity for
the failures has blinded. Mankind has been
shrewdly divided into those who do things
and those who must get out of the way while things
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
are being done, and if the latter class do not
recognize their true function in life, they themselves
will suffer the most. The incompetent
have to be supported partially or wholly by the
competent, and, even for their own good, it
would be worth while for the incompetent to
encourage the freedom of action and the preponderant
reproduction of the abler and more
successful stocks. It is only where such stocks
abound that the nation is able to support and
carry along the heavy load of incompetence
kept alive by modern civilization."</p>

<p>In discussing the general subject of variation
and variability in this connection, we must take
always into account the biological distinction
between variation and functional modification,
between innate and acquired traits. Only the
former are of real and primary value in evolution.
The distinction is familiar and we cannot
dwell upon it here; but it is of particular importance
in dealing with social improvement
and we shall return to it in the next chapter.
Many "social variations" are in reality not
variations at all, but modifications; although
these may be of the greatest value to the in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>dividual
modified, they are artificial things
without permanent value to the race. So many
of the distinguishing personal traits are the
results of nurture rather than of nature. They
represent the result of the incidence of special
factors in the environment. It is extremely
difficult and at times impossible to distinguish
between variations and modifications in adult
characters, but in general the distinction is
usually clear upon careful analysis.</p>

<p>The changing of the innate characters of the
human race is a slow process, depending chiefly
upon the advantage taken of the appearance
of real mutational variations. On the other
hand, it is comparatively easy to improve the
condition of the individual by improving his
environing conditions&mdash;cleaning him, educating
him, leading him to higher ideals in his physical
and mental and moral life. But as this is
easy, so it is impermanent. All this is modificational
and has no influence upon the stock.
This is not opposed by the Eugenist; it simply
is no part of his province, for its effect is not
racial. By releasing a deforming pressure it
may permit the individual to come back to his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
real structurally determined condition, but the
structural condition itself is not thus affected.
It is temporary and must be done over with
each generation, or on account of the unfortunate
habit of "backsliding," even at intervals
shorter than that of a generation.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Let us now turn to another phase of our subject
and consider the biological methods of the
description and measurement of heredity, as a
preliminary to our next chapter in which we
shall discuss the bearings of the facts of human
heredity upon the possibility of the formation
of a permanently improved human breed.</p>

<p>The fact of heredity is one of the most familiar
and patent things about organisms.
"Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of
thistles?" For we may define heredity as the
fact of general resemblance between parent and
offspring. This simple definition is disappointing
to many persons. "Heredity" is so often
supposed popularly to refer only to some occasional,
striking, and unusual similarity within
a family respecting certain traits or peculiarities.
Very often the idea of heredity seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
shrouded in mystery: it is some uncanny relation
which explains peculiarities and helps the
novelist out of difficulties, but is itself inexplicable.
In truth, however, the fact that a boy,
like his father, has a head and a heart and
hands and feet, physical traits characteristic of
the human species, that he begins to walk and
talk and shave at about the same age as his
father did&mdash;all this is the fact of heredity. The
fact that guinea pigs produce guinea pigs and
not rabbits is the fact of heredity. Often it is
true that this resemblance is strikingly particular.
All know of family traits; we may have
our father's eyes or nose, our mother's hair or
disposition, a grandfather's determination or
a grandmother's patience. But these particular
individual resemblances are no more and
no less illustrations of heredity than the fact
that on the whole children are more like their
parents than like other human beings.</p>

<p>The subject of heredity is of supreme importance
in the practice of Eugenics. The facts of
no other department of biological inquiry are
of equal value, and at the same time there is
probably no biological subject regarding which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
there is so much misunderstanding. Of the
many phases of this extremely fascinating subject
there are chiefly two with which we are
particularly concerned as Eugenists. These
are the questions: first, how completely are all
the distinguishing traits of either or both parents
represented in the offspring; and, second,
how completely is each trait inherited that is
inherited at all? In other words, what we are
chiefly interested to know, as bearing upon the
subject in hand, is whether all or only some of
the characteristics of our parents are heritable,
and whether the offspring show each inherited
trait with the same intensity shown in the parent,
or more, or less.</p>

<p>One of the leading British students of heredity
has said that no one should undertake
the study of this subject unless he can instantly
detect and explain the fallacy involved in the
familiar conundrum, "Why do white sheep eat
more than black ones?" It is perhaps the elasticity
of our language that makes possible the
mental confusion involved in this question, but
yet it is certainly true that we do tend to confuse
individual and statistical statements. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
must remember, in connection with this subject
particularly, that an individual may belong to
a group without representing it, and that within
a group there are many more individuals
with average than with exceptional characteristics.
The mediocre is common, the extremes
are rare. And yet an unusual individual may
really be an outlying member of a normal
group.</p>

<p>In describing the facts of hereditary resemblance
between successive generations two
formulas are available. One deals ostensibly
with the individual&mdash;the Mendelian formula:
the other deals with the group&mdash;the statistical
formula. It seems entirely probable that these
are not formulas for describing two essentially
different processes or forms of heredity, but
that in reality these are two ways of describing
the same facts seen from two different points
of view. The Mendelian formula regards each
individual separately and describes its heredity
thus. The statistical formula regards the whole
group as the unit and considers the individual
not as such, but as one of the crowd, concerning
which statements can be made only in terms
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of averages and probabilities; black sheep and
white. Of these two formulas the Mendelian is
obviously of much the greater importance on
account of its more exact, more particular character;
its greater definiteness gives it a value
in the treatment of eugenic problems that statistical
statements must inherently lack. While
much has been written of late regarding the
Mendelian formula of heredity, we shall find it
profitable to repeat here its general outlines
and to recall a few of the essential features of
this important law that we shall make much use
of later.</p>

<p>Let us have a concrete illustration. One of
the simplest cases is that of the heredity of
color in the Andalusian fowl which has been so
clearly described by Bateson. There are two
established color varieties of this fowl, one with
a great deal of black and one that is white with
some black markings or "splashes"; for convenience
we may refer to these as the black and
white varieties respectively. Each of these
breeds true by itself. Black mated with black
produce none but black offspring, white mated
with white produce none but white offspring.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Crossing black and white, however, results in
the production of fowls with a sort of grayish
color, called "blue" by the fancier, though in
reality it is a fine mixture of black and white.
At first sight we seem to have a gray hybrid
race through the mixture of the black and the
white races. Not so: for if we continue to breed
successive generations from these blue hybrid
fowls we get three differently colored forms.
Some will be blue like the parents, some black
like one grandparent, some white like the other
grandparent. Not only this but we get certain
definite proportions among these three classes
of descendants. Of the total number of the immediate
offspring of the hybrid blues, approximately
one half will be blue like the parents,
approximately one fourth black, and one fourth
white like each of the grandparents. Now
comes the most important fact of all. These
blacks, bred together produce only blacks, the
whites similarly produce only whites; the blues,
on the other hand, when bred together produce
progeny sorting into the same original classes
and in the same proportions as were produced
by the blues of the original hybrid generation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Their blacks and whites each breed true, their
blues repeat the history of the preceding blues.
No race of the hybrid character can be established:
blues always produce blacks and whites,
as well as blues. A summary of this history
in graphic and diagrammatic form is given in
Fig. 7.</p>

<p>This law of heredity was first discovered
about forty-five years ago by Gregor Mendel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
working with peas in the garden of the Augustinian
monastery in Br&uuml;nn, Austria. His work
curiously failed to arouse the interest of contemporary
scientists and his results were soon
completely lost sight of. The independent rediscovery
of Mendel's formulas of heredity,
about ten years ago, was probably the most
important event in the history of biology and
evolution since the publication of "The Origin
of Species."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/fig8.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 8." title="Fig. 8." />
<p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span>&mdash;Diagram showing the course of color heredity in the
guinea pig, in which one color (black) completely dominates
another (white). Reference letters as in Fig. 7.</span></p></div>

<p>In most cases of Mendelian heredity the progeny
are less easily classified than in the case
above, because the hybrid individuals resemble
one or the other of the parents, quite or very
closely. For instance the crossing of the black
and white varieties of guinea pigs gives hybrids
that are all black like one parent. That is, when
the black and white characters are brought together
these do not appear to blend into a
gray or "blue," as in the case of the Andalusian
fowl, but one character alone appears; the
black seems to cover up or wipe out the white.
This illustrates the frequent phenomenon of
<i>dominance</i>; one of the two contrasting characters,
in this case the black color is said to dominate
over the other and the two traits are described
as <i>dominant</i> and <i>recessive</i> respectively.
Fig. 8 gives a graphic representation of the
history of such a cross. When the black looking
hybrids are crossed together the progeny
fall into but two groups, one resembling each
of the grandparental forms. Three fourths of
the progeny now resemble superficially the
hybrid form and at the same time one of
the grandparents&mdash;the dominating black form,
while the remaining fourth resembles the other
white grandparent. However, we know that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the black three fourths do not in reality constitute
a homogeneous class but that this includes
two distinct groups; one group of one
fourth of the whole number of progeny (i. e.,
one third of all the blacks) are truly black like
their black grandparents and in successive generations
will, if bred together, produce none but
blacks of the same character, i. e., pure blacks:
the remaining two fourths of the whole number
of progeny (two thirds of all the blacks) in this
generation are actually hybrids and in the next
generation, if bred together, will give the same
proportions of the two colors as were found in
the whole of the present generation, i. e., three
fourths black, one fourth white. Of these the
whites always produce whites, the blacks always
produce blacks and whites in the approximate
proportions of 3:1; a certain proportion
of these&mdash;one third (one fourth of the whole generation)
always remain blacks, the other two
thirds (one half of the whole generation) again
produce blacks and whites. In such cases as
this where the phenomenon of dominance appears,
and this is the usual course of events, it
is impossible to say which individuals <i>are</i> the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
hybrids. Only after their progeny are studied
can we say which <i>were</i> the hybrids.</p>

<p>In the crossing of the black and white Andalusian
fowls described above the phenomenon
of dominance does not appear; when the two
color characters are brought into a single individual
neither appears alone, neither overcomes
nor is overcome by the other. In the
crossing of the black and white guinea pigs
dominance is complete; when the two color
characters are brought into a single individual
only one color appears, the second becomes recessive,
that is, it remains present as we know
from the later history of such hybrids, but it
is not visibly indicated. Besides the Andalusian
fowls there are known several other instances
of the absence of dominance and there
are many cases where dominance is incomplete,
i. e., where one character merely tends to dominate
the other. And in a few instances dominance
is irregular, i. e., sometimes one character
dominates, at other times or under other
circumstances it does not, as with certain forms
of the comb or the feathering of the legs in the
common fowl, or with the presence of an extra
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
toe in the domestic cat, the rabbit, and guinea
pig. And even in those cases where dominance
is said to be complete the trained eye of the
breeder can frequently distinguish between the
hybrid and the pure bred dominant individuals.
The phenomenon of dominance, therefore, is not
an essential of the Mendelian theory although
it is a frequent, we may say usual, relation.</p>

<p>It does not come within our province to attempt
an explanation of this formula of heredity
by describing some of the more fundamental
conditions upon which it depends. In
fact, no complete explanation is yet possible,
although several explanatory hypotheses have
been suggested. We may outline briefly that
which seems the most satisfactory in that it
serves to account for most of the facts in Mendelian
heredity in a comparatively simple manner.
The germ of an organism, we have seen,
somehow contains dispositions of materials
which primarily determine the characteristics
of the organism developed from that germ. To
these dispositions or configurations the term of
"determiners" has been applied. In a pure
variety like the black Andalusians, all the germ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cells of each fowl are alike in having this determiner
for black color. When two such fowls
are mated together their descendants will result
from the fusion of two germ cells, <i>each</i> containing
the determiner for black color; that is,
the germ of the new individual comes to have
a double determiner, one from each parent, for
this trait. In the white variety all the germ
cells are alike in <i>lacking</i> this determiner; blackness
is entirely absent and all their descendants
are formed from germ cells entirely without
black determiners. When the single germ cell
of a black fowl with its single black determiner
is fertilized by a germ cell from a white fowl
without any determiner for black the resulting
hybrid has a color produced by only a single
determiner, that from the black parent, and in
this case the blackness is not as fully expressed
because produced by only this single determiner
and the fowl appears gray or "blue";
that is, the black produced by a single determiner
is in this case not as black as that produced
by the double determiner. Now of
course this hybrid fowl forms germ cells containing
determiners for color, but these cells,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
instead of being all alike and with semi-black
determiners corresponding with the semi-black
characteristics of the individual, are of two
different kinds&mdash;some are like those of each of
the grandparents which fused to give origin to
the parent forms, and these are formed in approximately
equal numbers&mdash;one half with the
black determiner, one half without it. When
two such fowls are bred together the chances
are equal for certain combinations of germ
cells; the chances are equal that the "black"
or "white" germ cell of the one individual
shall meet and conjugate with the "black" or
"white" germ cell of the other individual. The
result may be expressed algebraically as follows,
using the letters <i>B</i> and <i>W</i> to indicate respectively
germ cells with and without the black
color determiner.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="70%" summary="Germ Combos">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
That is, one fourth are pure black (<i>BB</i>), one
fourth pure white (<i>WW</i>), and the remaining
half are hybrids, black and white (<i>BW</i>). The
pure blacks again form germ cells, all possessing
the determiner for blackness; the pure
whites form germ cells all lacking the determiner
for blackness; the hybrid blues produce
again equal numbers of germ cells possessing
and lacking the determiner for blackness. The
relation of the germ cells and the organisms
forming them and developing from them is
shown in the diagram in Fig. 9.</p>

<p>In the more common cases where the phenomenon
of dominance appears, as in the guinea
pig, this is explained by saying that here a single
determiner for blackness is somehow sufficient
to produce the color. In such cases the
black color observed may result either from a
single (<i>BW</i>) or from a double (<i>BB</i>) black determiner
in the germ which forms the organism.
Only when the black determiner is entirely
absent (<i>WW</i>) does the white color appear in
the developed organism and the individual is
then said to exhibit the recessive characteristic.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Another possible type of mating is that between
a member of a pure race, either dominant
or recessive, and a hybrid individual. This
form of mating is very common in some of the
pedigrees that we shall examine later. The results
of such a mating, first between a hybrid
and a recessive individual can be most easily
described by considering a cross between black
and white forms and expressing the result
algebraically.</p>

<p>In the case of the guinea pigs, although the
progeny all look alike (black) their history
would show that they were fundamentally unlike,
for if crossed with white again the result
would be the production of all black looking
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
guinea pigs from the cross with the <i>BB</i> forms,
and half black and half white from the <i>BW</i>
cross.</p>

<p>On account of the fact of variation every individual
is in a certain sense a hybrid. One's
two parents have the species characters in common
but there are certain distinctive traits that
hybridize and follow Mendel's law of heredity.
By no means is it to be understood that all
individual distinctive traits follow this rule in
heredity. Many individual characteristics are
what we have learned to call fluctuations&mdash;small
deviations above or below an average condition
of a group. Such differences play no part in
Mendelian heredity. Other characteristics may
be bodily modifications resulting from the direct
reaction between the body tissues and the
environing conditions; such traits would not
be represented in the organization of the germ
cells and consequently would not be inherited
at all. At present it seems that the only characteristics
that "Mendelize" are those known as
"unit characters." Such characters seem to
have their origin in real variations or mutations
and though each may show fluctuations,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
these fluctuations in themselves are not hereditary.</p>

<p>This conception of the unit character is an
extremely important element in the whole Mendelian
theory and it has extended beyond the
field of heredity and led to a radical change in
our notions of what an organism really is. It
is, of course, true in a sense that an organism
is a unit, an organism is one thing; but at the
same time it is true that an organism is fundamentally
a collection of units, of structural and
functional characteristics which are really separable
things. A few of these units were mentioned
in the first pages of this chapter and
others are mentioned on a later page. They
serve as the building blocks of organisms: individuals
of the same species may be made up
of similar combinations or of different combinations.
One unit or a group of units may be
taken out and replaced by others.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of heredity, and particularly
from our eugenic point of view, the
most important results of the unit composition
of the organism lie in the fact that these units
remain units throughout successive generations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
and throughout successive and varying combinations,
whatever their associations may be
from generation to generation. It is a fact of
the greatest eugenic significance that a pure
bred individual may be produced by a hybrid
mated either with a pure bred or with another
hybrid; and that the pure bred resulting will
be just as pure bred as any. "Pure bred" now
means pure bred with respect to certain traits
only. An individual may be pure bred in certain
of its characteristics, hybrid in others.
Practically there is no such thing as an individual
which is either pure bred or hybrid in <i>all</i>
its traits. One of the chief contributions, then,
of Mendelism to the subjects of Heredity and
Eugenics is this&mdash;that a pure bred may be derived
from a hybrid in one generation: the pure
bred produced by a long series of hybrid individuals
is just as pure as the pure bred which
has never had a hybrid in its ancestry. Another
important consequent is, that among the
offspring of the same parents some individuals
may be pure bred and others hybrid. Community
of parentage does not necessarily denote
community of characteristics among the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
offspring. Yet by knowing the ancestry for
one or two generations we can know the qualities
of the individual. Guesswork is eliminated
and the importance of the qualities of the individual
is enormously emphasized. It is necessary
only to suggest the social and eugenic
significance of such facts relating to characteristics
that are of social or racial importance.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion in the next chapter
to enumerate some of the human unit characters
whose heredity has been traced and which
have been found to Mendelize, but we may mention
here a few Mendelizing units in other organisms
in order to give some idea of the kind
of character which behaves as a unit and of the
range of the forms which have been found to
show Mendelian phenomena in their heredity.
Among the higher animals one might mention
the absence of horns in cattle and sheep; the
"waltzing" habit of mice and the pacing gait
of the horse; length of hair and smoothness of
coat in the rabbit and guinea pig; presence of
an extra toe in the cat, guinea pig, rabbit, fowl;
length of tail in the cat; and in the common fowl
such characters as the shape and size of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
comb, presence of a crest or a "muff," a high
nostril, rumplessness, feathering of the legs,
"frizzling" of the feathers, certain characters
of the voice, and a tendency to brood. Among
plants may be mentioned such characters as
dwarfness in garden peas, sweet peas, and some
kinds of beans; smoothness or prickliness of
stem in the jimson weed and crowfoot; leaf
characters in a great variety of plants; in the
cotton plant a half dozen characters have been
found to Mendelize; seed characters such as
form and amount of starch, sugar, or gluten;
flat or hooded standard in the sweet pea; annual
or biennial habit in the henbane; susceptibility
to a rust disease in wheat. We should not
fail to mention that scores of color characters
are known to Mendelize, such as hair or coat
color and eye color in animals and the colors
of flowers, stems, seeds, seed-coats, etc., in
plants. The list of Mendelizing traits in different
organisms now extends into the hundreds
and is increasing almost weekly.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of Mendelism we
should say that the phenomena, as described
above in the Andalusian fowl and guinea pig,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
are among the simplest known. And while
such simple formulas serve to describe the phenomena
of heredity in a large number of instances,
yet in a great many other cases the
descriptive formulas are more complicated.
We cannot in this place describe any of these
complications. For a full discussion of these
and of the whole subject of Mendelism the interested
reader is referred to Professor Bateson's
work on "Mendel's Principles of Heredity"
(1909). It must suffice to say here that
in color heredity, for example, such ratios as
9:3:4 or 12:3:1 in the second filial generation
instead of the more frequent 1:2:1 or 3:1 are
explainable upon essentially the same relations
as these simpler and more typical ratios. And
further, many less usual Mendelian phenomena,
which we cannot undertake to describe here, are
associated with what the specialist technically
terms "sex limitation," "gametic coupling,"
and the like.</p>

<p>It is often said that the Mendelian formula
has a very limited applicability to human heredity.
This is probably true if we consider
carefully the grammatical tense in which this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
statement is made. And yet it is almost certainly
true that heredity in man is to be described
by this law. This apparent paradox is
easily explained. The only characters whose
history in heredity follows this formula are the
unit characters. A complex trait is not heritable,
as a whole, but its components behave in
heredity as the separate units. It is perfectly
well known that we are deeply ignorant regarding
this phase of human structure. Our ignorance
here is not the necessary kind, however, it
is merely due to the newness of the subject&mdash;we
have not had time to find out. How can we
say that a complex trait is or is not inherited
according to some form of Mendel's law when
we do not know the nature of the units of which
it is composed? We can make no statements
about the Mendelian inheritance of such a trait
until it is factored into its units. A considerable
number of human characteristics are
really known to be heritable according to this
formula, enough so that several general rules
of human heredity have been formulated. But
it is also quite within the range of possibility
that some traits really do not follow this law,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
although it cannot yet be said definitely that
this is or is not the case. On the whole, then,
we cannot, for the next few years, expect too
much from the application of Mendel's laws to
human heredity, however much this is to be
regretted.</p>

<p>Shall we then decline to say anything about
the heredity of the great bulk of human characteristics?
By no means: we have seen that
in our bagatelle board we talk very definitely
about the distribution of all the peas, though
only about the probable history of one pea.
Mendel's law deals with individual inheritance.
When we cannot apply this formula we have
left still the possibility of talking about human
heredity in the group as a whole. That is to
say, we have left the opportunity of describing
heredity by the statistical methods, with the
crowd, not the individual, as the unit. Since
we are forced into extensive use of this formula
by our present and temporary ignorance of the
applicability of Mendel's rule we must get a
clear notion of how the statistical method is
applied in this matter.</p>

<p>The method is the same as that employed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the statistician in measuring the relatedness of
any two series of varying phenomena. If two
quantities or characteristics are so related that
fluctuations in the one are accompanied in a
regular manner by fluctuations in the other, the
two quantities or characters are said to be correlated.
For instance, the temperature and the
rate of growth of sprouting beans are related
in such a way that increase in the former is accompanied
in a regular way by increase in the
latter; or the width and height of the head, or
the total stature and the length of the femur
similarly vary regularly together so that they
are said to be correlated to a certain extent
which can be measured. This correlation may
result from the fact that one condition is a
cause, either direct or indirect, of the other; or
there may be no such causal relation between
the two phenomena, both resulting more or less
independently from a common antecedent condition
or cause.</p>

<p>This phenomenon of correlation is not limited
among organisms to the comparison of two
or more different characters in a single series
of individuals; it is applicable also to the comparison
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of two series of individuals with respect
to the same characteristic. Thus we may
compare the stature of a series of fathers with
the same measurement in their sons. It is this
form of correlation with which we are particularly
to deal here. While it is not necessary to
understand just how this subject is dealt with
by the statistician we should know one or two
of the elementary principles involved, in order
to appreciate the statistical form of many
statements about heredity.</p>

<p>The stature of men may be said to vary
usually between limits of 62 and 76 inches,
the average height being about 69 inches. In
the complete absence of heredity in stature we
should find that fathers of any given height,
say 62 or 63 or 76 inches would have sons of
no particular height but of all heights with an
average of 69 inches, the same as in the whole
group. Or if stature were completely heritable
from one generation to the next the <i>total generations
being the units compared</i>, then 62 or
63 or 76 inch fathers would have respectively
sons all 62, 63, and 76 inches tall. When we
examine the actual details of the resemblance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
we find, as a matter of fact, that neither of
these possibilities is actually realized. What
we do find is that fathers below or above the
average height have sons whose average height
is also below or above the general average but
not so far below or above the general average
as were the fathers. If we measured a large
number of pairs of fathers and sons with respect
to stature we should find each generation
with a variability such as that illustrated in
Fig. 3 of the stature of mothers, the limits here,
however, being about 62 and 76 inches. But if
we measured all the sons of 62-inch fathers
they would be found to vary say from 62 to
only 69 inches, averaging about 66 inches.
Similarly 63-inch fathers would have sons from
62 to 70 inches tall, averaging about 66.5 inches,
or 76-inch fathers might have sons from 69 to
76 inches in height, averaging about 72 inches,
and so on for fathers of all heights. In general,
then, we may say that fathers with a
characteristic of a certain plus or minus deviation
from the average of the whole group
have sons who on the whole deviate in the same
direction but less widely than the fathers, although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the fact of variability comes in so that
some few of the sons deviate as widely as, or
even more widely than, the fathers, others deviate
less widely than the fathers from the
average of the whole group. This is the general
and very important statistical fact of
<i>regression</i>.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of regression may be made
somewhat clearer by the aid of a simple diagram&mdash;Fig.
10. Here are plotted first the
heights, by inches, of a group of fathers, giving
the series of dots joined by the diagonal <i>AB</i>.
Next are plotted the average heights of the
sons of each class of fathers: 62-inch fathers
give 66-inch sons, 63-inch fathers 66.5-inch sons,
64-inch fathers 67-inch sons, and so for all the
classes of fathers. These dots are then joined
by the line <i>EF</i>. This is the <i>regression line</i>.
Had it been the case that there was no regression
in stature the different classes of fathers
would have had sons averaging just the same
as themselves and the line representing the
heights of the sons would have coincided with
the line <i>AB</i>. Or if regression had been complete
the fathers of any class would have had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
sons averaging about 69 inches&mdash;just the same
as the average of the whole group&mdash;and the line
representing their heights would have had the
position of <i>CD</i> in the diagram. As a matter of
fact, however, neither of these possibilities is
actually realized and the regression line <i>EF</i> is
approximated in an actual series of data. A
similar relation has been found for many characters
other than stature.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 70%;">
<img src="images/fig10.png" width="100%" alt="Fig. 10." title="Fig. 10." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10.</span>&mdash;Diagram illustrating the phenomenon of regression.<br />
Explanation in text.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
The fact of regression is of considerable importance
for the theory of evolution as well as
for the subject of Eugenics when describing
the phenomena of heredity in this statistical
manner in whole groups without paying attention
to particular individuals. Regression is
found in all characteristics observed in this
way, psychic as well as purely physical. "The
father [i. e., fathers] with a great excess of the<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">character contributes [contribute] sons with</span><br />
an excess, but a less excess of it; the father
[fathers] with a great defect of the character
contributes [contribute] sons with a defect, but
less defect of it."</p>

<p>Now, whatever the actual extent of this regression
is in a group we need to know how
uniformly it occurs for all the classes of different<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">deviations from the general average,</span><br />
that is, we need to know whether the extreme
groups regress to the same relative extent as
do those nearer the general average; and, further,
we need to know how nearly the sons of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
fathers of any certain height are grouped about
their own average. In other words, we should
know, first, whether the regression of the sons
of 62 and 76 or 67 and 71 inch fathers is proportionately
the same in each case, and, second,
to what extent the sons of 62-inch fathers
vary, whether they vary as do the fathers of
62-inch sons, and so for each group. This kind
of information we get by calculating what is
called the <i>coefficient of heredity</i>. The calculation
of this coefficient is a complicated process
which it is unnecessary to describe here. It
must suffice to say that a numerical coefficient
can readily be determined, which will express
the average closeness and regularity of the relationship
between all the plus and minus deviations
from the group average in fathers and
the corresponding plus and minus deviations
from the group average of their sons with respect
to a given characteristic. This coefficient
of heredity may vary between 0.0 and 1.0.
When it is 0.0 there is, on the whole, no regularity
in the relationship, i. e., no heredity;
when it is 1.0 there is, on the whole, complete
regularity, i. e., heredity is complete. Neither
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of these values is ever actually found in determining
coefficients of heredity in the parental
relation; these are usually between 0.3 and 0.5.
It should be emphasized again that this comparison
is between whole groups and not between
individuals, and that it fails to allow for
the distinction between fluctuations and true
variations. And, further, it should be noted
that the information derived from such a coefficient
is defective in that it takes into account
only the relationship between the son and one
parent; the maternal relation is just as important
but this has to be determined separately.
There is no satisfactory method of determining
the relation between children and both parents
at the same time.</p>

<p>The coefficient of heredity is, therefore, an
abstract numerical value which gives us a
fairly precise estimate as to the probable closeness
of the relation between deviations from
the group average of any character in two
groups of relatives. The coefficient of <i>correlation</i>
is, in general, a measure of the relation
between two different characteristics or conditions
in a single group of individuals. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
method of its determination and its limiting
values are the same as for the coefficient of
heredity.</p>

<p>By experience the coefficients of heredity and
correlation in general are found to have the following
significance:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="Correlation Table">
<tr><td align="left">0.00-</td><td>no relation.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">0.00-0.10&mdash;</td><td>no significant relation.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">0.10-0.25&mdash;</td><td>low; relation slight though appreciable.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">0.25-0.50&mdash;</td><td>moderate; relation considerable.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">0.50-0.75&mdash;</td><td>high; relation marked.</td></tr>

<tr><td align="right">0.90-1.00&mdash;</td><td>nearly complete.</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1.00&mdash;</td><td>complete relation.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>One further point remains to be considered,
which applies not so much to coefficients of
heredity as to coefficients of correlation in general,
i. e., to the relatedness of two different
characters or series of events in a single group
of cases or individuals. This is that coefficients
of correlation may be either positive or negative.
That is, the real limits of the value of
the coefficient are plus one and minus one. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
example given above of stature of fathers and
sons gives a positive coefficient. Whenever the
deviation from the average of one group is accompanied
in the second group by a deviation
in the same direction, the coefficient is positive.
A negative correlation means that deviation
from the average in a given direction in the
first group is accompanied in the second group
by a deviation in the opposite direction. If we
imagine that as one measurement increased
above its average a second related measurement
decreased below its average the correlation
in such a case would be negative. For instance,
if we measured the relation between the
number of berry pickers employed and the
quantity of berries remaining unpicked, in a
number of different fields we would get a negative
correlation coefficient. Some organisms
are formed in such a way that increase in one
dimension, such as length, is associated with
decrease in another, such as breadth; measurement
of the relatedness of these dimensions
would give a coefficient of correlation that
might be very high, indicating a considerable
relation in the deviations, but it would be negative.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
In an instance of negative correlation
the relation is that of "the more the fewer."
As we shall see presently, a negative correlation
may be just as important and significant
as a positive correlation.</p>

<p>The application of the principles of heredity
to our subject of Eugenics is of such great
importance that it is reserved for separate
consideration in the next chapter. We may,
therefore, devote the remainder of this chapter
to the consideration of data of another
kind, which are commonly treated by this same
method of determining correlation coefficients
between two sets of varying phenomena in
order to determine whether there is any actual
relation between them or not. This will serve
to illustrate the use of this method.</p>

<p>We shall turn then to the subject of differential
or selective fertility in human beings and
consider its relation to Eugenics. As a starting
point we may take the self-evident statement
that a group of organisms will tend to
maintain constant characteristics through successive
generations only when all parts of the
group are equally fertile. If exceptional fertility
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
is associated with the presence or absence
of any characteristic the number of individuals
with or without that trait will either increase or
diminish in successive generations, and the
character of the distribution of the group as a
whole will gradually become altered, the average
moving in the direction of the more fertile
group. Or if infertility is so associated, then
the average of the whole group moves away
from that condition. Eugenically, then, we
should ask whether in human society there is at
present any such association of superfertility or
infertility with desirable or undesirable traits.
It is obviously the aim of Eugenics to bring
about an association of a high degree of fertility
with desirable traits and a low degree of
fertility with undesirable characteristics.</p>

<p>First, let us look at certain data gathered
relative to the size of the family in both normal
and pathological stocks (Table II). In
order that a stock or family should just maintain
its numbers undiminished through successive
generations and under average conditions,
at least four children should be born to
each marriage that has any children at all.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
The table given shows clearly what stocks are
maintaining, what increasing, and what diminishing
their numbers.</p>

This subject has been investigated recently
in a rather extensive way by David Heron, for
the London population. Heron concentrated
his attention upon the relation of fertility in
man to social status. He used as indices to
social status such marks as the relative number
of professional men in a community, or the
relative number of servants employed, or of
lowest type of male laborers, or of pawn-brokers;
also the amount of child employment
pauperism, overcrowding in the home,
tuberculosis, and pauper lunacy. Twenty-seven
metropolitan boroughs of London were
canvassed on these bases, which are certainly
significant, though not infallible, indices to
the character of a community. His results
are shown in the briefest possible form in
Table III.</p>

<p>This table gives the results of the calculation
of coefficients of correlation between the birth
rates and the conditions enumerated. We may
just recall that this coefficient is a measure of
the regularity with which the changes in two
varying conditions or phenomena are associated:
and further that a coefficient of 1.0 indicates
perfectly regular association, 0.75 a very
high degree of regularity. The first line of the
table then, for example, means that when these
twenty-seven districts were sorted out, first,
with reference to the number of professional
men dwelling in them, and then with reference
to their respective birth rates, there was found
a very high degree of regularity (coefficient of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
correlation=-.78) in the association of these
two conditions&mdash;birth rate and number of professional
men. Here is a very close relation,
<i>but</i>, the sign of the coefficient is <i>negative</i>. The
significance of this negative sign is that among
the communities studied those where the number
of professional men is the larger show
always, at the same time, the lower birth rates.
Coming to the second line of the table, it seems
fair to assume that the number of servants employed
in a district in proportion to the total
number of residents or families there, gives a
fairly though not wholly satisfactory indication
of the social character of the community.
Measurement of the actual relation between the
proportional number of servants employed in
a community and the birth rate in that community,
gave practically the same result as in
the case of the number of professional men.
The more servants employed in a district the
lower its birth rate. Two methods of measuring
this relation gave essentially the same result;
comparison of the birth rate with the ratio
of domestics, first to the number of families,
second to the number of females, gave -.76 and -.80
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
respectively&mdash;very high coefficients and
both negative.</p>

<p>But the sign changes and becomes positive
when we come to other comparisons. When we
count the relative number of pawnbrokers and
general dealers, of "general laborers" (that is,
men without a trade and without regularity of
occupation and employment), of employed children
between the ages of ten and fourteen, of
persons living more than two in a room, when
we consider the infant death rate, the death
rate from pulmonary tuberculosis, and the relative
number of paupers,&mdash;then we find the signs
of the coefficients are all positive, and on the
average the coefficients are more than 0.50&mdash;a
moderate to high degree of regularity of the
relation. The districts characterized by the
larger numbers of such individuals or by higher
death rates of these kinds, are at the same time
the districts where the birth rates are the
higher.</p>

<p>In a word, then, Heron found that the greater
the number of professional men, or of servants
employed in a community, the lower the birth
rate&mdash;a very high degree of negative correlation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
On the other hand, the more pawn-brokers,
child laborers, pauper lunatics, the
more overcrowding and tuberculosis, the higher
the birth rate&mdash;a high degree of positive correlation.
Little doubt here as to which elements
of the city are making the greater contributions
to the next generation. There may
be some doubt, however, so let us consider two
possible qualifications of these results. First,
is not the death rate also higher among these
least desirable classes? Yes, it is. Is it not
enough higher to compensate for the difference
in the birth rates, so that after all the least
desirable classes are not more than replacing
themselves? No, it is not. After calculating
the effect of the differential death rate among
these different social groups it still remains
true that the <i>net</i> fertility of the undesirables
is greater than the <i>net</i> fertility of the desirables:
the worst classes are in reality more
than replacing themselves numerically in such
communities; the most valuable classes are not
even replacing themselves. Second, is not this
the same condition that has always existed in
these districts? Why any cause for supposing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
that this is going to bring new results to this
society? Has not such a condition always been
present and always been compensated for somehow?
Fortunately, Heron is able to compare
with these data of 1901 similar data for 1851,
and is able to show that every one of these relations
has changed in sign since that date&mdash;in
fifty years. The significance of this change in
sign is probably clear. It means here that in
London sixty years ago there was a high degree
of regularity in the relation such that the
more professional men and well-to-do families
the community contained, the higher the birth
rate; that ten years ago this had all become
changed so that the more of these desirable
families found in a district the lower is the
birth rate. It means that sixty years ago the
relation was such that the more undesirables
numbered in a district, the lower its birth rate;
ten years ago the more undesirables, the higher
the birth rate, and the coefficients of 1901 are
unusually high, indicating great closeness and
regularity in this relation. Heron is further
able to show that as regards number of servants
employed, professional men, general laborers,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
and pawnbrokers in a district, the
intensity of the relationship has <i>doubled</i>,
besides changing in sign, in the period observed.
It is not necessary to review the history
of this change nor to discuss the causes
involved, but it is necessary to take into account
for the immediate future the fact of the
change.</p>

<p>Sidney Webb has recently published an account
of the birth-rate investigations undertaken
by the Fabian Society with a view to determine
the causes leading to the rapidly falling
birth rate in England. During the decade
previous to 1901 the number of children in London
actually diminished by about 5,000, while
the total population increased by about 300,000.
As far as they bear upon this phase of the subject
his results fully confirm these we have
been considering. The falling off is chiefly in
the upper and middle classes, in the classes of
thrift and independence, and it has occurred
chiefly during the last fifty years. Webb cannot
find that this is due to any physical deterioration
in these classes; it is due to a conscious
and deliberate limitation of the size of the family
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
for what are thought prudential and economic
reasons.</p>

<p>An actual reduction in the number of children
may not be an unmixed evil. A falling
birth rate may be a good sign. This is partly
a question for the political economist. "Suicide"
may be a socially fortunate end for some
strains. But when, in either a rising or a falling
birth rate, we find a differential or selective
relation, then the subject is eugenic. If the
higher birth rate is among the socially valuable
elements of each different class the Eugenist
can only approve; to bring about such a relation
is one of his aims. What we really find,
however, is the undesirable elements increasing
with the greatest rapidity, the better elements
not even holding their own.</p>

<p>One further aspect of the result of the
smaller family remains to be considered. Are
the various members of a single family approximately
similar in their characteristics or
are the earlier born more or less likely to be
particularly gifted or particularly liable to disease
or abnormal condition? Or is there no
rule at all in this matter? There is much evidence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
that the incidence of pathological defect
falls heaviest upon the earlier members of a
family. Consider, for example, the presence
of tuberculosis. We should ask, in families
of two or more, are the tubercular members,
if any, as likely to be the second born or third
or tenth as to be the first born? The data
are tabulated in Fig. 11, <i>A</i>. The distribution
of family sizes being what it is in the number
of families investigated and tabulated,
we should expect that there would be about 65
tubercular first born, 60 tubercular second born,
and so forth, on the basis of its average frequency
in the whole community, provided the
chances are equal that any member of the family
should be affected with tuberculosis. What
we actually find, however, is that 112 first born
are affected, about 80 second born, and after
that no relation between order of birth and susceptibility
to tuberculosis. That is, susceptibility
to tuberculosis is double the normal
among first born children. The same thing is
true for gross mental defect. Fig. 11, <i>B</i>, shows
that the ratio of observed to expected insane
first born children is about 4 to 3. Such a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
relation has long been known to criminologists
and frequently commented upon. Fig. 11, <i>C</i>,
gives a definite expression to the facts here.
Whereas, in the number of families observed
about 56 criminal first born were to be expected,
the number actually found is about 120; for
the second born the corresponding numbers are
about 54 and 78, and after that no marked relation
is found between order of birth and criminality.
For albinism (Fig. 11, <i>D</i>) the expected
and observed numbers among first born are
about 185 and 265, second born 165 and 190,
and thereafter no definite relation. It remains
to be seen whether a similar relation holds for
the unusually able and valuable members of a
family; something has been said on both sides
here, but there are available at present no data
sufficiently exact to be worthy of consideration.</p>

<p><span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Diagrams showing the relation between order of birth
and incidence of pathological defect. (From Pearson).</span></p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
We have here a result that has very important
bearings upon the value to the race of the
large family and of the danger of the small
family. The small family of one, two, or three
children contributes on the average much more
than its share of pathological and defective persons.
No matter just now what the causes are,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
they seem to be more or less beyond remedy.
The result for the future, however, must be
reckoned with. This relation has important
bearings upon the custom of primogeniture as
well as upon the eugenic values of the large
family.</p>

<p>In conclusion let us give a few sentences only
slightly modified from Pearson's "Grammar of
Science." The subject of differential fertility
is not only vitally important for the theory of
evolution, but it is crucial for the stability of
civilized societies. If the type of maximum fertility
is not identical with the type fittest to survive
in a given environment, then only intensive
selection can keep the community stable.
If natural selection be suspended there results
a progressive change; the most fertile, whoever
they are, tend to multiply at an increasing rate.
In our modern societies natural selection has
been to some extent suspended; what test have
we then of the identity of the most fertile and
the most fit? It wants but very few generations
to carry the type from the fit to the unfit. The
aristocracy of the intellectual and artizan
classes are not equally fertile with the mediocre
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
and least valuable portions of those
classes and of society as a whole. Hence if the
professional and intellectual classes are to be
maintained in due proportions they must be
recruited from below. This is much more serious
than would appear at first sight. The upper
middle class is the backbone of a nation,
supplying its thinkers, leaders, and organizers.
This class is not a mushroom growth, but the
result of a long process of selecting the abler
and fitter members of society. The middle
classes produce relatively to the working
classes a vastly greater proportion of ability;
<i>it is not want of education, it is the want of
stock which is at the basis of this difference</i>.
A healthy society would have its maximum of
fertility in this class and recruit the artizan
class from the middle class rather than <i>vice
versa</i>. But what do we actually find? A growing
decrease in the birth rate of the middle and
upper classes; a strong movement for restraint
of fertility, and limitation of the family, touching
only the intellectual classes and the aristocracy
of the hand workers! Restraint and
limitation may be most social and at the same
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
time most eugenic if they begin in the first
place to check the fertility of the unfit; but if
they start at the wrong end of society they are
worse than useless, they are nationally disastrous
in their effects. The dearth of ability
at a time of crisis is the worst ill that can happen
to a people. Sitting quietly at home, a
nation may degenerate and collapse, simply
because it has given full play to selective reproduction
and not bred from its best. From the
standpoint of the patriot, no less than from
that of the evolutionist and Eugenist, differential
fertility is momentous; we must unreservedly
condemn all movements for restraint
of fertility which do not discriminate between
the fertility of the physically and mentally fit
and that of the unfit. Our social instincts have
reduced to a minimum the natural elimination
of the socially dangerous elements; they must
now lead us consciously to provide against the
worst effects of differential fertility&mdash;a survival
of the most fertile, when the most fertile
are not the socially fittest.</p>

<p>The subject before us illustrates the direct
bearing of science upon moral conduct and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
upon statecraft. The scientific study of man is
not merely a passive intellectual viewing of
nature. It teaches us the art of living, of building
up stable and dominant nations, and it is
of no greater importance for the scientist in his
laboratory, than for the statesman in council
and the philanthropist in society.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"A breed whose proof is in time and deeds;<br />
What we are, we are&mdash;nativity is answer enough to objections."<br />
</p></div>


<p>A few years ago official recognition was
taken of the disturbing fact that the
annual wheat yield of Great Britain
was grossly deficient in both quantity and
quality. In 1900 The National Association of
British and Irish Millers, with almost unprecedented
sagacity, raised a fund to provide for a
series of experiments under the direction of a
competent biologist, in order to discover if possible
some means of restoring the former yield
and quality of the native wheats. The story of
the result reads like a romance. The experimenter&mdash;Prof.
R. H. Biffen&mdash;collected many
different varieties of wheat, native and foreign,
each of which had some desirable qualities, and
studied their mode of inheritance. Now, after
only a few years of experimentation a wheat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
has been produced and is being grown upon a
large scale in which have been united this desirable
character of one variety, that character of
another. From each variety has been taken
some valuable trait, and these have all been
combined into one variety possessing the characteristics
of a short full head, beardlessness,
high gluten content, immunity to the devastating
rust, a strong supporting straw, and a high
yield per acre. A wheat made to order and fulfilling
the "details and specifications" of the
growers.</p>

<p>Manitoba and British Columbia opened up
whole new lands of the finest wheat-growing
capacity, but the season there is too short for
the ripening of what were the finest varieties.
This new specification was promptly met and
the early ripening quality of some inferior
variety was transferred to the varieties showing
other highly desirable qualities, and these
countries are now producing enormous quantities
of the finest wheat in the world.</p>

<p>All of this has been made possible by the discovery,
mentioned in the preceding chapter,
that many characteristics of organisms are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
units and behave as such in heredity; they can
be added to races or subtracted from them
almost at will. Pure varieties breeding true
can be established permanently by taking into
account the Mendelian laws of heredity. Similar
results have been accomplished in many
other plants and in many animals. A cotton
has been produced which combines early
growth, by which it escapes the ravages of the
boll weevil, with the long fiber of the finest Sea
Island varieties. Corn of almost any desired
percentage of sugar or starch, within limits,
can be produced to order in a few seasons. The
hornless character of certain varieties of cattle
can be transferred to any chosen breed. Sheep
have been produced combining the excellent
mutton qualities of one breed with the hornlessness
of another, and with the fine wool
qualities of still a third. And so on from canary
birds to draft horses. New races can be
built up to meet almost any demand, with
almost any desired combination of known characters,
and these races remain stable. Possibilities
in this direction seem to be limited only
by our present and rapidly lessening ignorance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
of the facts of Mendelian heredity in organisms&mdash;facts
to be had for the looking.</p>

<p>What is man that we should not be mindful
of him? Why should we utilize all this new
knowledge, all these immense possibilities of
control and of creation, only for our pigs and
cabbages? In this era of conservation should
not our profoundest concern be the conservation
of human protoplasm? "The State has
no material resources at all comparable with
its citizens, and no hope of perpetuity except
in the intelligence and integrity of its people."
As Saleeby puts it: "There is no wealth but
life; and if the inherent quality of life fails,
neither battle-ships, nor libraries, nor symphonies,
nor Free Trade, nor Tariff Reform, nor
anything else will save a nation."</p>

<p>In this work of the creation and establishment
of new and valuable varieties, two essential
biological facts are made use of. The raw
materials are furnished by variation&mdash;by the
fact that there are individual and racial differences.
The means of accomplishing results are
furnished by heredity&mdash;the fact that offspring
resemble the parents, not only in generalities,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
but even in particulars, and according to certain
definite formulas.</p>

<p>And, further, in the formation and establishment
of a new race of plant or animal a conscious
and ideal process is involved. The will
of some organism guides the process, carefully
doing away with hit and miss methods, and
proceeding as directly as may be possible to
an end <i>desired</i>. The facts of variation and
heredity are sufficiently demonstrated for all
organisms other than man; are they true of
man also? Have we available the possibilities
for the improvement of the human breed? If
not, Eugenics is merely an interesting speculation.
We have mentioned already the facts
of variation in man; we undoubtedly do have
the raw materials. What about heredity, and
what about the directive agency? Let us look
now at some of the facts of human heredity
and consider some of the possibilities in the
way of directive agencies. Is it going to be
possible to breed a stable human race permanently
with or without definite characteristics
which now appear only in certain groups, or
sporadically as variations?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
At the outset we should say that the knowledge
of human heredity is as yet largely of the
statistical sort. We know how a great many
characters are inherited, on the average. The
subject of Mendelian heredity is so new that
there has been hardly time to investigate more
than a few human characteristics from this
point of view. Certain conditions add to the
difficulties here. First, many, probably most,
of the more important human traits are complexes,
not units, and it is a long and difficult
process to analyze them into their units, with
which alone Mendelism deals. Second, in human
society we cannot carry on definite experiments
under controlled conditions, directed
toward the solution of some concrete problem
in heredity. It is true that Nature herself is
making such experiments constantly, but at
random, and rarely under ideal conditions of
what the experimenter calls control or check.
We have first to seek and find them out, and
when they are found we often discover that
there are lacking many of the facts essential
to a complete or satisfactory analysis of the
facts displayed. The comparatively small size
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
of the human family sometimes makes it difficult
to get data sufficiently extensive to be
really significant. And the long period that
elapses between successive human generations
adds to the difficulty of getting precise information,
for in dealing with the heredity of some
traits comparisons must be made with individuals
of the same ages, and the period of
observation of a single observer seldom exceeds
the duration of a single generation. Yet
in spite of all these difficulties we have a fairly
broad and exact knowledge of human heredity
in respect to some characteristics.</p>

<p>Human heredity involves both physical and
psychical characters&mdash;both the body and the
mind are concerned. Among other animals
little if anything is known regarding psychic
inheritance, but the physical traits of men are
inherited in just the same ways and to the same
degrees as in animals. This degree or intensity
of inheritance may be expressed in coefficients
of heredity between the groups of relatives
being compared. To mention a few
examples of coefficients for physical traits we
have the following:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="90%" summary="Character Table">

<tr><td>Cephalic Index (Ratio between breadth<br />and length of cranium)</td><td></td><td></td><td align="right">.49</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<p>We might give many others, but it is unnecessary.
Notice that these parental and fraternal
coefficients group about an average value of
about .50 or slightly less. Similar coefficients
have been worked out for other degrees of relationship;
thus grandparental coefficients are
about .25.</p>

<p>Stated briefly, in less exact terms, these coefficients
mean that, with respect to such traits
as deviate from the group average, the resemblance
of brothers and sisters to each other or
of children to their parents is, on the whole,
approximately mid-way between being complete
in its deviation from the average and in
not deviating at all from the average in the
direction of the fraternal or parental characteristic.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
Grandchildren tend to deviate from
the group average only about one fourth as far
as their grandparents. It should be remembered
that these are statistical and not individual
statements, and that as many "exceptions"
will be found in the direction of greater resemblance
as in that of lesser resemblance.</p>

<p>One of the present objects of the student of
heredity, perhaps his chief object, is to be able
to state the facts of human heredity in Mendelian
terms, reducing many of the complex human
traits to their simpler elements. Some of
the chief objections to the use of the statistical
formula of heredity are that apparently it is
applicable only to the fluctuating variabilities
of organisms; that it rarely takes into account
the presence of (and therefore the heredity of)
true variations or mutations&mdash;and we have
seen that it is just these characters that are of
the greatest value in evolution; and that heredity
is after all fundamentally an individual relation
which loses much of its definiteness and
significance when we merge the individual in
with a crowd. To some these seem fatal objections
to any use of the statistical formula and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
it is certainly true that they greatly limit its
value. But for the present at least the statistical
statement of certain facts of heredity is still
useful in this bio-social field. We may therefore
use the statistical formulas of heredity as
a kind of temporary expedient, enabling us to
make statements regarding inheritance of certain
characters in the group or class, pending
the time when we shall be able to give the facts
a more precise and more "final" expression in
Mendelian formulas. Many human traits are
indeed already known to Mendelize. Most of
these are, however, "abnormal" traits or
pathological conditions; we are still in the dark
regarding the actually Mendelian or non-Mendelian
inheritance of most of man's normal
characteristics. We might enumerate the following
Mendelizing human characters&mdash;eye
color, color blindness, hair color and curliness,
albinism (absence of pigment), brachydactylism
(two joints instead of three in fingers and
toes), syndactylism (union of certain fingers
and toes), polydactylism (one or more additional
fingers or toes in each hand or foot),
keratosis (unusually thick and horny skin),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
h&aelig;mophilia (lack of clotting property in the
blood), nightblindness (ability to see only in
strong light&mdash;a retinal defect usually), certain
forms of deaf mutism and cataract, imbecility,
Huntington's chorea (a form of dementia).</p>

<p>In observing Mendelian heredity we should
bear in mind that a given character may be due
either to the presence or to the absence of a
"determiner" in the germ. Long hair such
as is characteristic of many "Angora" varieties
of the guinea pig and cat, for example, is
believed to be due to the absence of a determiner
which stops its growth. Blue eyes are
due to the absence of a brown pigment determiner,
<i>et cetera</i>. The presence or absence in
the offspring of such characters as we know
do Mendelize can be predicted when we know
the parental history for two generations.</p>

<p>Turning now to the inheritance of mental
traits and including, of course, moral traits
here as well, we find that we are almost entirely
limited to the statistical statement of results.
Pearson found upon examining data from a
large number of school children, brothers and
sisters, that the coefficients of heredity between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
them were the same as for their physical traits.
His results are summarized in Figure 12. The
physical traits measured were, in the order
plotted in the figure&mdash;health, eye color, hair
color, hair curliness, cephalic index (ratio between
breadth and length of cranium), head
length, head breadth, head height. These gave
an average of .54 in brothers, .53 in sisters, and
.51 in brothers and sisters. The psychical
traits in order were&mdash;vivacity, assertiveness,
introspection, popularity, conscientiousness,
temper, ability, handwriting. The corresponding
averages were .52, .51, .52.</p>

<p>Galton's pioneer works on "Hereditary Genius,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
"English Men of Science," and "Natural
Inheritance" showed with great clearness the
fact of mental and moral heredity. Wood's
recent extensive study of "Mental and Moral
Heredity in Royalty" shows the same thing,
although not all the results of these investigations
are given in mathematical form. Little
can be said regarding Mendelian heredity of
mental traits because the psychologist has not
yet told us how to analyze even the common
and simpler psychic characters into their fundamental
units; since we do not know what
the mental hereditary units are, obviously we
cannot work with them. Much of our knowledge
in this field does not permit of very accurate
summary, though pointing indisputably
to the fact of mental inheritance in spite of
the very great influences of training and education,
environment and tradition, in moulding
the mental and moral characteristics&mdash;influences
with much greater effect here than in
connection with physical characters.</p>

<p>Galton studied the parentage of 207 Fellows
of the Royal Society, a Fellowship which is a
real mark of distinction. He assumed that one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
per cent of the individuals represented by the
class from which his observations were drawn,
that is the higher intellectual classes, might be
expected to be "noteworthy": among the general
population the average is really about one
in 4,000 or one fortieth of one per cent. On
the one per cent basis Galton found that Fellows
of the Royal Society had noteworthy
fathers with 24 times the frequency to be expected
in the absence of heredity; noteworthy
brothers with 31 times the expected frequency;
noteworthy grandfathers 12 times; and so on
through various grades of relationship.</p>

<p>Schuster examined the class lists of Oxford
covering a period of 92 years and found that
first honor men had 36 per cent first or second
honor fathers; second honor men had 32 per
cent first or second honor fathers; ordinary degree
men 14 per cent first or second honor
fathers. These percentages are far in excess
of that to be expected&mdash;perhaps 0.5 per cent&mdash;on
the assumption that ability is not inherited.
Schuster also determined the coefficients of
heredity between fathers and sons as regards
intellectual ability, the evidence being class
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
marks in Oxford and Harrow; these he found
to be about .3 for the parental relation and .4
for the fraternal. The intensity of heredity
in many forms of insanity has been determined
and this runs up much higher&mdash;.57 parental
and .50 fraternal.</p>

<p>It is clear I take it, that the fact of human
heredity does not concern only physical traits
but extends to psychical traits as well, and with
about the same intensity. This fact has been
found true also for still less analyzable characters
such as length of life, fertility or infertility
and the like, and again about the same intensity
of resemblance is found.</p>

<p>Human heredity is a fact then just as human
variability is a fact. We have truly the raw
materials and the means for racial improvement.
The ability to direct the evolution of
the human race makes this our supremest duty.</p>

<p>The facts of human heredity can more easily
be brought home to us by the examination of
some actual pedigrees and family histories.
We may look at a few representative cases
which will serve to bring out some additional
aspects of the significance to society of the demonstrated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
fact of heredity. In the examination
of single family histories we should remember
that a single pedigree may not accurately illustrate
a general law of heredity&mdash;again, an
individual case may belong to a group of cases
without representing them fairly. Even in observing
illustrations of Mendel's laws allowance
has to be made for the variability due
to "chance" meetings of germ cells. It
is only when large numbers of individuals
are observed that the typical Mendelian
fractions and ratios can be strictly observed.
It must be borne in mind then that the
histories given below illustrate the nature of
the facts of heredity rather than the laws of
heredity. Some special cautions in the interpretation
of certain pedigrees will be suggested
in particular cases. Many of the figures are
taken from the extremely valuable "Treasury
of Human Inheritance," now being published by
the Eugenics Laboratory of the University of
London. In these figures and some others a
uniform series of symbols is used. Successive
horizontal lines designated by Roman numerals
indicate generations; within a single generation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
the individuals are numbered consecutively
simply for purposes of reference. The meaning
of the more common symbols is as shown in
Table IV. We may first consider a few pedigrees
showing the heredity of physical abnormalities
or defects.</p>

Farabee's data. (From "Treasury of Human Inheritance.")</span></div>

<p>Fig. 13 illustrates a family history where
brachydactylism (an abnormality of the digits
commonly called shortfingeredness, due to the
lack of one joint in each digit) is present and
frequently associated with dwarfism. We may
describe this case rather fully because it illustrates
nicely the heredity of a trait according
to the Mendelian formula. The parentage
of the affected female (II, 1) who started this
line is uncertain. The marriage was with a
normal male whose parentage is unknown but
evidently normal. This pair produced 11 children,
the character of 8 of whom is known; 4
were affected, 4 unaffected, a Mendelian ratio
resulting from the mating of a normal with a
hybrid individual, the observed character dominating
(i. e., the abnormality appearing in the
hybrid individuals). According to Mendelian
laws, the normal offspring of affected hybrids
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
when mated with normals should produce all
normal offspring; this result is shown clearly
through generations IV-VI, where no affected
individuals are produced by two normal parents,
although one or two of the grandparents were
affected. Marriage of a normal person with
one affected parent is fit because this individual
is wholly without germinal determiners for this
character. Marriage between a normal and an
affected person is unfit (or it would be if the
observed character were a serious defect) because
approximately one half their offspring
will be affected like the one parent. Thus in
IV, 7-21, we see 12 children from one such
marriage, 7 of whom are affected, 5 unaffected.
All of the 11 children of the 5 unaffected are
normal, while of the 16 children of the affected
persons, all of whom that married at all married
normal individuals, 9 were affected, 7 unaffected.
Similar relations are found in generation
VI, where the 9 affected persons in V
married normals, producing 33 children, 15 of
whom were affected, 18 unaffected. Taking
all the offspring of marriages between unaffected
and affected (hybrid) persons through
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the four generations III-VI, we find 35 affected
and 33 unaffected, with the condition of
3 unknown. There is no instance in this pedigree
of the marriage of two affected persons,
but such a marriage would be highly unfit
(again in the case of a serious defect) because
we know that all their offspring would be affected.
Mating of two unaffected persons,
even though each had one affected parent,
would be fit because the offspring would all be
unaffected, barring the possibility of a new variation
or mutation to this character, which
would be extremely unlikely. Such a pedigree
as this illustrates very well how a knowledge of
Mendelian heredity may be of the greatest
value practically, in determining the fitness or
unfitness of marriages in families where an abnormality
or defect is known to occur. The
course of the inheritance here illustrates the
simplest form of Mendelism. We have already
indicated that there are many other forms
which we have not described and which we cannot
undertake to describe here on account of
their complexity; in such cases, however, it is
still possible to predict with fair accuracy the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
characters of the offspring of parents whose
history is known for one or two generations.</p>

<p>The defect we have just been considering is
dominant. Many defects are recessive, i. e.,
transmitted though not exhibited by a hybrid
individual. Viewed from the standpoint of the
character of the offspring, mating with such a
person would be unfit only when both persons
were similarly recessives. Such a chance similarity
would be likely only in cases of blood
relationship. Here lies the scientific basis for
many of the legal restrictions against cousin
marriage or the marriage of closer relatives,
for here, although both persons may appear
normal, the chances for latent ills appearing in
the progeny in a pure and permanently fixed
condition are greatly increased. Of course the
same relation holds for characteristics which
are not defects but really valuable traits. Marriage
of cousins possessing valuable characters,
whether apparent or not, might be allowed or
encouraged as a means of rendering permanent
a rare and valuable family trait which
might otherwise be much less likely to become
an established characteristic. Some discrimination
should be exercised in the control, legal
or otherwise, of such marriages.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
Fig. 14 gives a brief pedigree of a family
in which polydactylism occurs. This is a condition
in which one or more additional or supernumerary
fingers or toes are present in the
extremities. The Mendelian character of the
heredity of this defect is less clear than in the
preceding, yet there are many indications that
this is really an illustration of a complex Mendelian
formula. Probably if the parentage of the
individuals marrying into this family were
known we should be able to give a complete
formula. At any rate the pedigree illustrates
the unfit character of the matings with affected
persons, for in no instance has such a marriage
resulted in the production of fewer than one
half affected offspring.</p>

<p>Fig. 15 illustrates a form of what is known
as "split hand" or "lobster claw," where certain
digits may be absent in the hands and feet.
In this case all the digits are absent except the
fifth. This is frequently associated with syndactylism
or the fusion of the remaining digits
into one or two groups. When present this
usually affects all four extremities. Two pedigrees
of this defect are illustrated in Fig.
16. Here again we have a defect whose inheritance
follows quite closely the Mendelian formula,
although the character of the matings is
not fully known; it is unnecessary to describe
the details&mdash;the histories speak for themselves.</p>

Fig. 17 illustrates a pedigree of congenital
cataract. This history is less satisfactory because
the matings are given in only three instances.
It is known from other data that this
defect follows simple Mendelian laws. Normal
individuals produce only normals, while
affected persons produce one half or all affected
offspring according to the character of
the mating.</p>

<p>Fig. 18 illustrates the heredity of another defect
of the eye called night blindness. This is
a retinal defect, the affected being able to see
only in strong illumination. The particular
form of the disease in this family resulted in
total blindness later in life. Little is known
definitely concerning the character of the matings;
no mating is known to have been with an
affected person and some are known to have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
been with unaffected. Of the 42 descendants of
the first affected person only 6 are known to
have been unaffected. Can there be any doubt
regarding the unfitness of these matings? In
generation III a single mating led to a family
of 10 children <i>all</i> affected by this serious defect,
rendering them dependents.</p>

<p>One of the most complete pedigrees of a defect
on record is given in condensed form in
Fig. 19. This summarizes the extraordinarily
complete data of Nettleship covering nine, and
in one branch ten, consecutive generations.
The defect is another form of night blindness
as it existed in a French family. The inheritance
is obviously Mendelian: no affected persons
are produced by unaffected parents, although
their own brothers or sisters or one
parent may have been affected. The pedigree
gives the history of 2,040 persons, all descended
from one affected individual. Of these 135
were known to have been affected, and all were
children of affected parentage. Of the total
number of progeny of affected persons mated
with normals, 130 were reported as affected
and 242 as unaffected.</p>

We may consider next the hereditary history
of some forms of nervous defect, the exact
nature of the causes of which can be less
definitely stated than in all of the preceding
instances of defect. Fig. 20 gives a brief
history of the heredity of Huntington's chorea&mdash;a
form of insanity which here resulted in
the death of all but one of the affected persons
in the first four generations; the fifth
generation is the present and is incomplete.
Although the matings were with normals in
every case, yet in four of the eight marriages
all of the offspring were affected. From one
affected male 23 affected persons descended
in four generations and their multiplication
is still going on. There can be no doubt
as to the unfitness of marriage into such a
family.</p>

A very complete family history showing deaf-mutism
is given in Fig. 21. It cannot be said
that in every case here the defect is innate,
i. e., hereditary, and it is not known that the
cause of the defect was the same in every family
concerned, for deaf-mutism may result from
several different causes. In most cases in this
history, however, the defect behaves like a
Mendelian dominant. In certain other cases
it is clearly known to follow the Mendelian formula.
Such pedigrees as this show how dangerous
it is to marry into a family in which this
defect exists.</p>

<p>Goddard has recently published several family
histories showing feeble-mindedness. One
of the most significant of these&mdash;significant
both socially and eugenically&mdash;is summarized
here in Fig. 22. Of this Goddard writes:
"Here we have a feeble-minded woman [IV, 3]
who has had three husbands (including one
'who was not her husband'), and the result
has been nothing but feeble-minded children.
The story may be told as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 100%;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Family history showing a form of night blindness.
(Condensed form of Nettleship's data.)</span></div>

<p>"This woman was a handsome girl, apparently
having inherited some refinement from her
mother, although her father was a feeble-minded,
alcoholic brute. Somewhere about the
age of seventeen or eighteen she went out to do
housework in a family in one of the towns of
this State [New Jersey]. She soon became the
mother of an illegitimate child. It was born
in an almshouse to which she fled after she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
been discharged from the home where she had
been at work. After this, charitably disposed
people tried to do what they could for her, giving
her a home for herself and her child in
return for the work which she could do. However,
she soon appeared in the same condition.
An effort was then made to discover the father
of this second child, and when he was found to
be a drunken, feeble-minded epileptic living in
the neighborhood, in order to save the legitimacy
of the child, her friends [<i>sic</i>] saw to it
that a marriage ceremony took place. Later
another feeble-minded child was born to them.
Then the whole family secured a home with an
unmarried farmer in the neighborhood. They
lived there together until another child was
forthcoming which the husband refused to own.
When, finally, the farmer acknowledged this
child to be his, the same good friends [<i>sic</i>] interfered,
went into the courts and procured a
divorce from the husband, and had the woman
married to the father of the expected fourth
child. This proved to be feeble-minded, and
they have had four other feeble-minded children,
making eight in all, born of this woman.
There have also been one child stillborn and
one miscarriage.</p>

"As will be seen from the chart, this woman
had four feeble-minded brothers and sisters
[IV, 6, 10, 15, 16]. These are all married and
have children. The older of the two sisters
had a child by her own father, when she was
thirteen years old. The child died at about
six years of age. This woman has since married.
The two brothers have each at least one
child of whose mental condition nothing is
known. The other sister married a feeble-minded
man and had three children. Two of
these are feeble-minded and the other died in
infancy. There were six other brothers and
sisters that died in infancy."</p>

<p>The paternal ancestry of this unfortunate
woman is hardly less interesting, as may be
seen from the diagram. All told, this family
history, as far as it is known, includes 59 persons;
the mental character of 12 of these is unknown;
10 died in infancy or before their characteristics
were known; of the remaining 37, 30 were feeble-minded.</p>

Turning now to defects of other kinds, an
interesting history is illustrated in Fig. 23. Here
a single individual fatally affected with angio-neurotic
&#339;dema gave rise, in four completed
generations, to 113 persons, 43 of whom were
affected. In 11 this disease was the direct
cause of death. The Mendelian character of
the heredity here can be neither asserted nor
denied. In generations II-V matings between
normal and affected gave 42 affected and 35
unaffected offspring.</p>

(Data from Klebs, after Whetham in "Treasury of Human Inheritance.")</span></p></div>

<p>Fig. 24 gives a brief family history showing
pulmonary tuberculosis. In the history given
susceptibility to this disease behaves as a Mendelian
dominant. We cannot as yet say
whether this is or is not a general rule. In
describing the heredity of diseases primarily
due to infection, one or two important cautions
must be observed. Of course the source of the
infection cannot be "hereditary," and apparently
it is only in comparatively few instances
that infection occurs during fetal life. To
some infections certain persons are susceptible,
others are not; some when susceptible are capable
of developing immunity, others are not.
When an infection is of such character and
prevalence that practically all persons in approximately
similar environments of a given
character are infected, susceptibility or the
power of developing immunity will determine
whether or not an individual will exhibit the
disease caused by the infective agent. Practically
all persons living in the denser communities
are infected with tuberculosis; those who
are susceptible and incapable of developing immunity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
succumb, the insusceptible and those
developing immunity do not. These conditions
are heritable; but in speaking of the heredity of
such a disease as tuberculosis it should be clear
that the heredity concerned is really that of susceptibility
and the power of developing immunity.
Yet the person who is really susceptible
can, by taking sufficient precaution, escape serious
infection, and thus the result for that person
would be the same as if he were insusceptible,
but his offspring would have to take
similar precautions if they were to escape the
disease.</p>


<p>We cannot speak of heredity in connection
with diseases to which all are susceptible and
incapable of developing immunity. The presence
or absence of such a disease is determined
solely by the presence or absence of infection.
Many physical and mental defects result from
infection as the primary cause. If the infection
is one to which all exposed are susceptible
and incapable of developing immunity we cannot
speak of the defect as in any way hereditary;
if the infection is one to which some are
susceptible, others not, to which some can develop
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
immunity, others cannot, then we may
speak of the defect as hereditary. Thus certain
forms of blindness or insanity are due primarily
to gonorrheal or syphilitic infection, insusceptibility
to which is rare or unknown.
Such defects cannot be considered as affording
evidence of heredity though they reappear in
successive generations.</p>

<p>In general the subject of the heredity of immunity
and susceptibility forms one of the most
important eugenic aspects of this whole subject.
In a few cases it is known that immunity or insusceptibility
to specific forms of infection is a
unit character which follows Mendelian laws in
heredity. It can be added to races or subtracted
from them and pure bred immune races
built up. So far this has not been demonstrated
for man. There is some circumstantial
evidence that immunity to specific forms of infection
has been a great, although hitherto neglected,
factor in man's evolution, and even in
the history of his civilization and conquest. It
is at once obvious that here is a great field for
the common labor of the students of heredity
and of medicine and of Eugenics.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
Fig. 25 illustrates a family history of infertility.
This is apparently hereditary, but before
that could be asserted definitely to be so
here or in any similar case, we should know
that the infertility were not the result of an
infection to which immunity is rare or unknown.
That infertility is really hereditary in this instance
is indicated, first, by the fact that the person
marked A later, by a second marriage into
fertile stock, had a large family, and second, by
the fact that the individual B and his child by
marriage into fertile stocks produced in the last
generation again a large family and so saved
this whole family from extinction.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the heredity of
the kinds of traits we have been using as illustrations,
we should add just a word. It is
often objected that one cannot properly speak
of the heredity of such general things as "insanity"
or "deaf-mutism" or "blindness" or
"heart disease," because each of these includes
a great variety of specific forms of these disorders
which cannot strictly, medically, be compared.
But the student of heredity replies
that when he speaks of the heredity of insanity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
or heart disease, that is often just what he
means. He means that often no particular
form of these defects is necessarily strictly
heritable as such, but that in a family there
may be a general instability of nervous system
or circulatory system, which may take any one
of several possible specific forms, the form actually
appearing depending upon particular
conditions which are frequently environmental
and beyond determination. In some cases specific
forms of disorder are actually heritable as
such.</p>

<p>Such an inclusive thing as "ability" may depend
upon many different specific conditions.
Yet there are families in which persons of exceptional
ability are unusually frequent. The
fact that persons of ability are more frequent
in certain families than in the general population
of the same social class and with about the
same opportunity for the demonstration of inherent
ability, gives evidence of its heredity,
although we may not be able to summarize the
facts under any particular law but must adhere
to their statistical expression.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
Figs. 26 and 27 illustrate two such pedigrees
of ability. In each of these histories there is
also a line of "unsoundness" the descent of
which it is interesting to trace. It is instructive
to compare here the progeny of matings
of different kinds. In generation IV of
Fig. 26, the 9th and 10th persons are brother
and sister. The sister was of considerable ability
and married into a family of ability, producing
8 offspring, 5 of whom were able. The
brother was a "normal" person and married
a similar individual, producing 10 "normal"
children. It would be interesting to know the
details regarding these two large families of
cousins. Another interesting comparison is
found in this pedigree. The four able brothers
in generation III, coming from a stock of demonstrated
ability, married women of undemonstrated
ability and all told had 13 children (IV)
of whom only 3 showed ability and all of these
were in a single family. In this family of the
fourth brother two of the able members married
into able families, and among their 11 children
(second and fifth families in generation
V) 8 showed ability; the third able member of
this family, however, married as her uncles
had, a person not known as able, and none of
their 6 children showed unusual ability (sixth
family in generation V). Fig. 27 affords other
illustrations of this same kind. Thus in generation
III the 5th and 7th persons are able
cousins of able parentage. The former married
a normal and 1 of their 5 children showed
ability; the latter married a person of ability
and 5 of their 8 children showed ability. In
both pedigrees the "careers" of those in the
last generation are partly incomplete.</p>

In discussing pedigrees of ability it should
be borne in mind that the larger proportion of
able males as compared with females is hardly
significant for the study of heredity; it may
merely reflect the unfortunate fact that women
have not had the same opportunity to demonstrate
inherent ability as have men; or it may
evidence the still more unfortunate fact that
the distinguished achievements of able women
have not been socially recognized as such and
recorded as they have been for the other sex.</p>

pedigree of three very able and well-known
families. In this history only persons whose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
ability is in science are marked as able.
Charles Darwin is the third individual in the
third generation. His cousin, Francis Galton,
the founder of Eugenics, is the next to the last
person in the same generation.</p>

<p>Many similar cases of the unusual frequency
of individuals of musical or religious ability in
certain families have been published by Galton
and are well known. "As long as ability marries
ability, a large proportion of able offspring
is a certainty, and ability is a more valuable
heirloom in a family than mere material wealth,
which, moreover, will follow ability sooner or
later."</p>

<p>We might contrast with such families as have
been recorded in the three preceding figures
some well-known families at the other pole of
society. As an interesting example we have the
family described by Poellmann. This was established
by two daughters of a woman drunkard
who in five or six generations produced all
told 834 descendants. The histories of 709 of
these are known. Of the 709, 107 were of illegitimate
birth; 64 were inmates of almshouses;
162 were professional beggars; 164 were prostitutes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
and 17 procurers; 76 had served sentences
in prison aggregating 116 years; 7 were
condemned for murder. This family is still a
fertile one and the cost to the State, i. e., the
taxpayers, already a million and a quarter dollars,
is still increasing.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28.</span>&mdash;History (condensed and incomplete)
of three markedly able families. (From Whetham.)</span></div>

<p>One of the best known families of this type is
the so-called "Jukes" family of New York
State so carefully investigated by Dugdale.
This family is traced from the five daughters of
a lazy and irresponsible fisherman born in 1720.
In five generations this family numbered about
1,200 persons, including nearly 200 who married
into it. The histories of 540 of these are well
known and about 500 more are partly known.
This family history was easier to follow than
are some others because there was very little
marriage with the foreign-born&mdash;"a distinctively
American family." Of these 1,200 idle,
ignorant, lewd, vicious, pauper, diseased, imbecile,
insane, and criminal specimens of humanity,
about 300 died in infancy. Of the remaining
900, 310 were professional paupers in
almshouses a total of 2,300 years (at whose expense?);
440 were physically wrecked by their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
own diseased wickedness; more than half of the
women were prostitutes; 130 were convicted
criminals; 60 were habitual thieves; 7 were murderers.
Not one had even a common school education.
Only 20 learned a trade, and 10 of these
learned it in State prison! They have cost the
State over a million and a quarter dollars, and
the cost is still going on. Who pays this
bill? What right had an intelligent and humane
society to allow these poor unfortunates
to be born into the kind of lives they had to
lead, not by choice but by the disadvantage of
birth? Darwin wrote long ago "... except
in the case of man himself, hardly anyone
is so ignorant as to allow his worst animals
to breed."</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29.</span>&mdash;History of <i>Die Familie Zero</i>.
(Condensed from J&ouml;rger's data, partly after Davenport.)</span></div>

<p>Probably the most complete family history of
this kind ever worked out is that of the "Familie
Zero"&mdash;a Swiss family whose pedigree has
been recently unraveled in a splendid manner
by J&ouml;rger. In the seventeenth century this family
divided into three lines; two of these have
ever since remained valued and highly respected
families, while the third has descended to the
depths. This third line was established by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
man who was himself the result of two generations
of intermarriage, the second tainted with
insanity. He was of roving disposition, and in
the Valla Fontana found an Italian vagrant wife
of vicious character. Their son inherited fully
his parental traits and himself married a member
of a German vagabond family&mdash;Marcus,
known to this day as a vagabond family. This
marriage sealed the fate of their hundreds of
descendants. This pair had seven children, all
characterized by vagabondage, thievery, drunkenness,
mental and physical defect, and immorality.
Their history for the three succeeding
generations is incompletely summarized in
Fig. 29. In 1905, 190 members of this family
were known to be living, and probably many
living are unknown on account of illegitimate
birth.</p>

<p>In 1861 a sympathetic and charitable priest
attempted to save from their obvious fate many
of these "Zero" children and others who resided
in and near his village, by placing them
in industrious and respectable families to be
reared under more favorable auspices. The
attempt failed utterly, for every one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
"Zero" children either ran away or was enticed
away by his relatives.</p>

<p>The blame for such an atrocity as this family
or the Jukes does not rest with these persons
themselves; it must be placed squarely
upon the shoulders and consciences of the intelligent
members of society who have permitted
these predetermined degenerates to be brought
into the world, and who are to-day taking no
broadly sympathetic view of their treatment by
exercising preventive measures. <i>Laissez faire?</i></p>

<p>At the risk of easing the conscience, let us
finally return to the other side of society and
look at a summarized statement of the Edwards
Family given by Boies and drawn from Winship's
account of the descendants of Jonathan
Edwards. "1,394 of his descendants were identified
in 1900, of whom 295 were college graduates;
13 presidents of our greatest colleges; 65
professors in colleges, besides many principals
of other important educational institutions; 60
physicians, many of whom were eminent; 100
and more clergymen, missionaries, or theological
professors; 75 were officers in the army and
navy; 60 prominent authors and writers, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
whom 135 books of merit were written and published
and 18 important periodicals edited; 33
American States and several foreign countries,
and 92 American cities and many foreign cities,
have profited by the beneficent influence of
their eminent activity; 100 and more were lawyers,
of whom one was our most eminent professor
of law; 30 were judges; 80 held public
office, of whom one was Vice President of the
United States; 3 were United States Senators;
several were governors, members of Congress,
framers of State constitutions, mayors of cities,
and ministers to foreign courts; one was president
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company;
15 railroads, many banks, insurance companies,
and large industrial enterprises have been indebted
to their management. Almost if not
every department of social progress and of the
public weal has felt the impulse of this healthy
and long-lived family. It is not known that any
one of them was ever convicted of crime."</p>

<p>The serious consideration of bodies of facts
like those contained in some of these pedigrees
leads every thoughtful and sympathetic, every
humanely minded, human being to ask&mdash;What
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
<i>can</i> we <i>do</i> about it? The display of such conditions
stimulates us to measures of relief. It is
greatly to be regretted that the honest desire to
do good often leads to the performance of ill-considered
or unconsidered acts which may
result in positive injury to the constitution of
society, or at any rate at best merely in the amelioration
of the immediate situation without reference
to ultimate profit or penalty, or to the
necessity for interminable amelioration. Such
relief leaves out of account the fact that modifications
are not heritable&mdash;not permanent, practically
without effect in the long run. "Good
intentions" have a certain well-known value as
paving material, but not as building material.</p>

<p>The science of Eugenics includes not only the
study of the data in this field, but further the
formulation of definite courses of procedure;
but it insists that these be based upon scientific
principles and not upon emotional states. Philanthropic
relief has become a serious business&mdash;is
becoming a science. Eugenics is a science
and it aims to put the human race upon such a
level that the need for philanthropic relief will
be less and continually less. We shall then be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
able to devote more of the resources of our time
and money and energy to the production of permanent
results. The Eugenist pleads in this
work for more sympathetic consideration of the
problems of relief&mdash;for a sympathy which is
wider, which transcends the individual person
and reaches the social group, even the nation
or race. For just as a society is something
more than the sum of its individual parts when
taken separately, so the consideration of all the
component individuals of a society taken separately
and by themselves, results in something
less than social consideration. Again "Charity
refers to the individual; Statesmanship to the
nation; Eugenics cares for both."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>What, then, does the Eugenist propose to do?
What is the eugenic program? Eugenics is
not an academic matter&mdash;not an armchair science.
It is intensely practical&mdash;so very practical,
indeed, that the Eugenist hesitates to
make many suggestions of a definite nature looking
directly and immediately toward specific action.
Something must precede action. The
Eugenist has been ridiculed as one responsible
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for the absurd schemes proposed in his name,
perhaps seriously, by the unscientific but well-intentioned
sympathizer. Many persons have
been led to object to what they believed to be a
eugenic program which is not a eugenic program
at all. Thus the willingness of some to
offer adverse criticism of the subject and its
aims has grown largely out of a common misconception
of the matter and has led Galton to
say, "As in most other cases of novel views, the
wrongheadedness of objectors to Eugenics has
been curious." As a scientist the Eugenist
realizes clearly and fully that his new science
is in a very early stage of its development. It
is just entering upon what are the first stages
in the history of any science, namely, the periods
of the formulation of elementary ideas and
the collection of facts. There are certain groups
of facts, however, of glaring significance and
undoubted meaning, and upon these as a basis
the Eugenist already has a few, a very few, concrete
suggestions for eugenic practice. In conclusion,
then, we may outline tentatively and
briefly a conservative eugenic program somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
First of all there must be an extensive collection
of exact data&mdash;of the facts regarding all
the varied aspects of racial history and evolution.
These facts must be collected with great
care and under the strictest scientific conditions.
In this matter particularly must we "desert
verbal discussion for statistical facts."
Figures can't lie, but liars can figure. What
we need first of all is the accumulation of masses
of cold, hard facts, uncolored by any point of
view, untinged by any propaganda: facts regarding
the net fertility of all classes; facts
regarding the racial effects of all sorts of environmental
and occupational conditions; facts
regarding variability and variation in the race;
facts regarding human heredity of normal and
pathological conditions, of physical and psychical
traits. We have merely scratched the surface
of the great masses of such data to be had
for the looking. As Davenport has recently put
it in his valuable essay on "Eugenics"&mdash;</p>

<p>"While the acquisition of new data is desirable,
much can be done by studying the extant
records of institutions. The amount of such
data is enormous. They lie hidden in records of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
our numerous charity organizations, our 42 institutions
for the feeble-minded, our 115 schools
and homes for the deaf and blind, our 350 hospitals
for the insane, our 1,200 refuge homes, our
1,300 prisons, our 1,500 hospitals and our 2,500
almshouses. Our great insurance companies
and our college gymnasiums have tens of thousands
of records of the characters of human
blood lines. These records should be studied,
their hereditary data sifted out and ... placed
in their proper relations" that we may learn of
"the great strains of human protoplasm that
are coursing through the country." Thus shall
we learn "not only the method of heredity of
human characteristics but we shall identify
those lines which supply our families of great
men: ... We shall also learn whence come our
300,000 insane and feeble-minded, our 160,000
blind or deaf, the 2,000,000 that are annually
cared for by our hospitals and Homes, our
80,000 prisoners and the thousands of criminals
that are not in prison, and our 100,000 paupers
in almshouses and out.</p>

<p>"This three or four per cent of our population
is a fearful drag on our civilization. Shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
we as an intelligent people, proud of our control
of nature in other respects, do nothing but vote
more taxes or be satisfied with the great gifts
and bequests that philanthropists have made
for the support of the delinquent, defective, and
dependent classes? Shall we not rather take
the steps that scientific study dictates as necessary
to dry up the springs that feed the torrent
of defective and degenerate protoplasm?</p>

<p>"Greater tasks than those contemplated in
the broadest scheme of the Eugenics committee
have been carried out in this country. If only
one half of one per cent of the 30 million dollars
annually spent on hospitals, 20 millions on
insane asylums, 20 millions for almshouses, 13
millions on prisons, and 5 millions on the feeble-minded,
deaf and blind were spent on the study
of the bad germ plasm that makes necessary
the annual expenditure of nearly 100 millions
in the care of its produce we might hope to
learn just how it is being reproduced and the
best way to diminish its further spread. A <i>new</i>
plague that rendered four per cent of our population,
chiefly at the most productive age, not
only incompetent, but a burden costing 100 million
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
dollars yearly to support, would instantly
attract universal attention, and millions would
be forthcoming for its study as they have been
for the study of cancer. But we have become
so used to crime, disease and degeneracy that
we take them as necessary evils. That they
were, in the world's ignorance, is granted.
That they must remain so, is denied."</p>

<p>Of course one should not jump from this to
the conclusion that the fact of heredity is responsible
for all of this defect. Disease is so
often the result of infections to which none is
immune, and defect is frequently the result of
such disease. Warbasse has recently stated
that "At least one fourth of our public institutions
for caring for defectives is made necessary
by venereal disease." Doubtless an appreciable
share of this fourth is the result of hereditary
tendencies, the expression of which gives the
opportunity for such infection. Here as elsewhere
no single factor accounts for all of the
facts, although when, as the result of the increase
of knowledge, we shall become able to
make more definite statements, we no doubt shall
find that heredity is the most important single
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
factor in the disgraceful prevalence of crime,
disease, and defect in our communities: indeed
this is practically demonstrated to-day. These
are questions of the most fundamental importance
in our national life-history: our only
"hope of perpetuity" lies in the right solution
of such problems. And the crying need is for
facts, always more facts.</p>

<p>The Galton Laboratory for Eugenics is already
doing much in this direction and is publishing
in the "Treasury of Human Inheritance"
scores of human pedigrees. An agency
is already in operation in this country. The
American Breeders Association has appointed
a Committee and Sub-Committees under highly
competent leaders for the collection of exact
data of human heredity upon a large scale.
There is opportunity for everyone to help in
this work in connection with the Eugenics Record
Office already referred to.</p>

<p>The second great element in the eugenic
program is Research. It is not enough to collect
the known facts; new facts must be forthcoming.
We cannot, perhaps, undertake definite
experiments upon human evolution, but we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
can and must take advantage of the wealth of
experiment which Nature is carrying out
around us and before our eyes could we but
learn to read her results. We need to know
more about the process of differential fertility,
of human variability, of the effects of Nurture
as well as of the conditions of Nature.</p>

<p>We do know pretty well the effects, upon the
individual, of training, education, good and ill
housing conditions and conditions of labor, of
disease, alcoholism, underfeeding. We need
now to know, not to guess at, the effects of these
things upon the race, upon human stock. A
mere beginning has been made here in the way
of a scientific treatment of this question, although
many persons have their minds already
made up, firmly and fully, as to the "effects of
the environment." But all that we have guessed
here may be wrong.</p>

<p>The discussion of this subject is filled with
pitfalls. The common form of the query as to
which is of the greater importance, "heredity
or environment," in determining individual
characteristics betrays a completely erroneous
view of what heredity is, and of the organism's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
relation to its environment. The living organism
reacts to its environment at every stage of
its existence, whether as an egg, an embryo, or
an adult. In this reaction both factors are essential,
the environment as essential as the organism.
The result of this continued reaction
is the development on the part of the organism
of certain physiological processes and structural
conditions or characteristics. The nature
of these resulting states, depending upon the
two factors&mdash;organism and environment&mdash;can be
changed by altering either factor. In general,
organisms develop under pretty much the same
conditions as their parents and general ancestry
did, and their germinal substances are directly
continuous, and therefore very similar. Consequently,
primary organic structure and environing
conditions of development being alike
through successive generations, the results of
their interaction are alike. This alikeness is
heredity&mdash;the fact of similarity between parent
and offspring. The usually indefinite question
as to the effect of the environment ordinarily
has a real meaning however, and this is, or
should be, whether the alteration of particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
elements of the environment, the presence of
special, unusual factors which cannot be said to
be "normally" present&mdash;whether these produce
any effect upon the organism which is truly
heritable.</p>

<p>This is in reality the old question of the "inheritance
of acquired characteristics," or, in a
word, of modifications&mdash;a question which has
been debated heatedly and at length. And as
in many similar instances the number of essays
and the length and heat of the debate have been
inversely as the number and clearness of the
pertinent facts. The large majority of biologists
have long felt that the great bulk of the
evidence was on one side, namely, that acquired
traits were not heritable. At the same time they
have recognized the difficulty of explaining certain
apparently demonstrated contradictory
facts. Some recent experimental work has
largely cleared away the theoretical difficulties
in this field, and the present status of the old and
really fundamental question may be stated as
follows: External conditions&mdash;climate, temperature,
moisture, nutritional conditions, results
of unusual activity, and the like&mdash;incidences of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
the environment, undoubtedly produce effects
upon the structure and behavior of the organism,
but these effects must be clearly grouped
into two distinct classes.</p>

<p>In the first place the effect of "external" conditions
may be to bring about a reaction between
the <i>bodily</i> parts affected and the environing
conditions. Here the body alone is modified
and not the germinal substance for the next
generation within this body. Such responses to
environing conditions do not affect nor involve
the structure of the germ, and are therefore unrepresented
in that series of reactions that result
in the production of an individual of the
next generation. In this class are found most
of the instances of "functional modification"
or acquired characteristics. In this category
belong most of the stock illustrations&mdash;from
the blacksmith's arm and the pianist's fingers,
to the giraffe's neck and the fox's cunning.
Here also belong the results of training and
education; we can train and educate brain cells
but not germ cells.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of most of these bodily
reactions to external conditions that they are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
adaptive; that is, when a body reacts to such
a condition it does so by undergoing a change
which makes the organism better fitted to the
new condition&mdash;better able to exist. The increased
keenness of vision, the strengthened
muscle, the thickened fur&mdash;all such changes
meet new or unusual demands in such a way
that the organism has better chances of survival
than it would have had unmodified.</p>

<p>But in the second place there are certain environmental
circumstances which do affect the
structure of the germinal substance within the
body of an organism. An unusually high temperature
acting at a certain period in the life-history
may bring about a change in the color
of insects which is heritable&mdash;i. e., racial; but
such a change results from the action of temperature
upon the germ directly and not alone
upon the body, which then itself affects the
germ. It is essential to recognize that in all
such cases it is not the structural change in the
body that affects the germ, but it is the external
condition itself that affects the germ directly.
This is not the half of a hair; it is an extremely
important and significant difference.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
The effects of this kind of action are not visible
until the generation following that acted upon.
They become expressed in the bodies of the organisms
developed from the affected germs.</p>

<p>It is characteristic of such changes as these
that they may not, usually do not, have an adaptive
relation to the condition bringing about the
change. There is no correspondence between
the bodily and the germinal modifications resulting
from the action of the same condition.
Furthermore, there seems to be no adaptive
relation between the general character of the
germinal disturbance and the environmental
disturbance. Rarely some of the organismal
characters resulting from such germinal modification
may be in the direction of greater
adaptedness; usually they are neutral or in the
direction of utter unfitness.</p>

<p>But such effects are heritable, whatever their
nature with respect to adaptedness, and it becomes
therefore very important to find out what
are the conditions that may thus disturb the normal
structure of the germ. Little more than a
beginning has been made here and practically
nothing can be said definitely with reference to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the human organism in this respect. Enough
is known, however, to make it clear that it is
only rarely indeed that external conditions can
thus affect the germinal structure. In most
cases the effects of the incidence of environment
are purely bodily. A most fruitful field for
eugenic investigation is open here.</p>

<p>One of the first problems to be attacked from
this point of view is that of the racial (i. e., heritable)
effects of such poisons as alcohol. It is
frequently said, for instance, that some of the
effects of alcoholism are the weakened, epileptic,
or feeble-minded conditions of the offspring,
who are also particularly liable to disease and
infection. It can hardly be said that this is as
yet thoroughly demonstrated. On account of
the importance of this question we might call
specific attention to some recent investigations
of the problem of the racial influence of alcohol.
The effects of alcohol upon the individual are
fairly well known, although still a matter for
debate in some quarters. But this is not as important
eugenically as the possible effect upon
the offspring of the use and abuse of alcohol by
the parents. An investigation has been carried
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
on recently through the Galton Laboratory for
National Eugenics directed toward ascertaining
the precise relation between alcoholism in parents
and the height, weight, general health, and
intelligence of their children. It was found to
be perfectly true that alcoholism and tuberculosis
show a high degree of association; but considering
the nondrinking members of the same
community just the same high frequency of tuberculosis
was found. And the presence of alcoholism
among parents was found to be practically
without effect upon the height and weight
of their offspring. "These results are certainly
startling and rather upset one's preconceived
ideas, but it is perhaps a consolation that to the
obvious and visible miseries of the children
arising from drink, lowered intelligence and
physique are not added."</p>

<p>The difficulties surrounding investigation and
the interpretation of the results of investigation
in this particular field are evidenced by the fact
that these results have been adversely criticised,
on the one hand, because "alcoholism"
was taken to mean the continued moderate use
of alcohol, and on the other because "alcoholism"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
was taken to mean only the occasional excessive
abuse of alcohol. Much of the confusion
surrounding the discussion of the racial effects
of alcohol grows out of the underlying confusion
of statistical and individual statements. It may
be left open, then, whether this result from the
Galton Laboratory is clearly demonstrated and
whether the basis of investigation was sufficiently
broad to make the facts of general applicability.</p>

<p>The frequent association between alcoholism
and certain forms of insanity is sometimes
taken as evidence of a racial effect. Here again
we find the question really left open when we
appeal to facts taken in large numbers. In a
few cases it seems to have been demonstrated
that saturation of the bodily tissues with alcohol
affects directly the structure of the germ cells
formed at that time, and that this effect is seen
in physical and mental disturbances of the offspring
derived from such germ cells, and thus
becomes hereditary or racial. But these results,
like those mentioned above, need confirmation.
The impairment of the child <i>in utero</i>
through maternal overindulgence in alcohol
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
would not necessarily denote any corresponding
germinal (i. e., racial) effect.</p>

<p>It is often the case that alcoholic excess, like
other forms of excess, may be an indication of
a lack of complete mental balance or sanity, sure
to have become expressed in some form. The
lack of balance in the offspring of such persons
is a simple case of heredity and not the result
of the parental use of alcohol. The alcoholism
of the parent was a result, an indication, and
not a cause. There may be instances of the
direct action of external conditions upon the
germ, and in a very true sense the body is a
part of the external environment of the germ,
but to say that such an action has been demonstrated
for alcohol is premature. It should be
easily possible to get real evidence upon this
and similar questions. But at present it is
safest to leave the whole question of the racial
effects of alcohol entirely open pending more
and better evidence.</p>

<p>To summarize, then, we may say that the evidence
for an inherited effect of the misuse of
alcohol is not as clear as one might wish; it
may be true. There is the greatest need for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the careful scientific investigation of this and
allied problems. Much of the evidence here is
not of the kind that can be used to prove things&mdash;it
consists largely of the demonstration of the
fact of association rather than of causation. In
order to show that a changed environment has
produced a change in the innate characters of
the organisms affected it must be demonstrated
that the organismal change continues to be inherited
after the environment has again become
what it was originally, and as yet this has not
been done. Indeed when tested in this way it is
found that a permanently heritable alteration
can thus be produced only rarely and by environmental
changes of the most profound character.</p>

<p>Research in another direction is greatly
needed. We should examine and re&euml;xamine current
as well as proposed social practices and
reforms from the racial point of view. We
should know before going much farther whether
the extensive social improvements that are annually
effected are to any considerable degree
racially permanent. We should investigate not
only the racial effects of the unfavorable social
conditions themselves, but also the racial effects
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of the measures directed toward the relief of
such conditions. It is conceivable that measures
of relief may be practically without permanent
effect or even racially detrimental. It
would seem that the social worker and philanthropist
should welcome any biologically fundamental
truths touching these questions, and
yet it is curiously true that there are some such
persons who seem to prefer not to know the
whole truth here, perhaps because they fear it
may disclose the unwelcome fact that much of
their effort has resulted in amelioration rather
than in correction. It should be remembered
that simple relief is well worth while, even
though often without resulting racial benefit.
When it is not actually detrimental racially, relief
is an economic, social, and moral duty. The
Eugenist, by disclosing the fact that racial
effects can actually be accomplished, enlarges
rather than diminishes the opportunities for relief
and his knowledge should be welcomed and
use made of it.</p>

<p>Heretofore the social point of view has been
practically the only point of view in much of
this work, and the result is that usually following
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
when action is based upon half-truth. David
Starr Jordan says: "Charity creates the misery
she tries to relieve; she never relieves half
the misery she creates," and he goes on to say
that <i>unwise</i> charity is responsible for half the
pauperism of the world; that it is the duty of
charity to remove the <i>causes</i> of weakness and
suffering and equally to see that weakness and
suffering are not needlessly perpetuated. In
this connection the following quotation from
Elderton is apt: "... the influence of the parental
environmental factor on the welfare of
children is ... at present and has been in the
past the chief direction of legislative and philanthropic
attack on social evils. Degeneracy of
every form has been attributed to poverty, bad
housing, unhealthy trades, drinking, industrial
occupation of women, and other direct or indirect
environmental influences on offspring. If
we could by education, by legislation, or by social
effort change the environmental conditions,
would the race at once rise to a markedly higher
standard of physique and mentality? Much, if
not the whole battle for social reform, has been
based on the assumption that this question was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
obviously to be answered in the affirmative. No
direct investigation has really ever been made
of the intensity of the influence of environment
on man. To modify the obviously repellent was
the immediate instinct of the more gently nurtured
and controlling social class. Was this direction
of social reform really capable of effecting
any substantial change? Nay, by lessening
the selective death rate, may it not have contributed
to emphasizing the very evils it was intended
to lessen? These are the problems which
occur to the eugenist and call for investigation
and, if possible, settlement.... It is conceivable
that the relation between children's physique,
for example, and parental occupation is an indirect
result of the inheritance of physique and a
correlation between parents' physique and their
occupation. In other words, what we are attributing
to environment may be a secondary influence
of heredity itself. A weakling may have no
option but to follow an unhealthy trade, a man
is a tailor or shoemaker, because he has not the
physique for smith or navvy. His offspring
may be physically inferior because he is a weakling
and not because he follows an unhealthy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
trade. Clearly, to solve our problem, we must
know if there be any correlation between the
same character in the parent as we are observing
in the child and the environment we are
correlating with the child's character. Unfortunately
data enabling us to determine the relationship
of any mental or physical character of
the parent with the environment which is supposed
to influence the child is rarely forthcoming."</p>

<p>Just to suggest one further train of thought,
we might point out that several movements apparently
of high social value have been attended
by a curious and largely unforeseen back action.
Thus the enforcement of certain forms
of Employer's Liability laws has led to discrimination
against married persons by large
employers of labor and a premium thus put upon
nonmarriage. The result of Child Labor legislation
has been in some cases an enormous
rise in the death rate of young children among
the classes concerned, indicating that the children
receive less care, now that they have ceased
to be a prospective family asset and have become
chiefly a burden for many years. In other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
cases the result has been so serious a limitation
in the birth rate that communities are dying
out and factories are closing for want of sufficient
help. Such problems are not only social
but economic and eugenic, and they cannot be
seen squarely from any single point of view. It
is doubtless shocking to the cultured mind that
the chief reason for bringing children into the
world should be their economic value as contributors
to the family income. But in reality does
this point of view differ fundamentally from
that very commonly taken of the value of a large
family except in the nature of the standard by
which their value is measured? May there not
be a difference of opinion as to whether children
are better or worse off when brought up with
some degree of care to be employed under humane
conditions of labor, than when left uncared
for to die in large proportions of disease
and neglect?</p>

<p>Finally, studies in heredity, whether on man
or on other animals or on plants, are sure to be
of value here because we know that the fundamental
processes of heredity are the same in all
organisms. Above all, the Eugenist needs to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
know more of Mendelian heredity in man. The
facts of heredity stated in the statistical form
of averages and coefficients do not affect the man
in the street materially&mdash;he rather enjoys taking
chances. An extensive eugenic practice can
be established only when we can say definitely
what the individual or family inheritance will
be in a given instance&mdash;not what it will be with
such and such a degree of probability, although
that probability be high. We may not be such a
long way off from this ideal, which is an essential
for the inauguration of eugenic practice
upon a large scale. For the Eugenist this is the
richest field for investigation and one which is
certain to yield large results.</p>

<p>The Eugenist's demand for more facts will
doubtless become an important factor in the
progress of biological science. The practical
application of the knowledge of heredity in
the production of domesticated or cultivated varieties
of animals and plants is becoming annually
more extensive; and with the recognition of
the possibility of the application of this knowledge
to the control of the evolution of man himself,
will come a rapid increase in biological
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
knowledge and in the earnestness of the student
of heredity. And at the same time another result
may be that the science of biology shall
come to be appraised publicly more nearly at its
real value. The biological worker knows that
his science comes into contact with human life
at every point, that a knowledge of the fundamental
principles of the science of life cannot
fail to enrich, enlighten, and ennoble the life of
every human being. But the community does
not yet realize this, to its own great loss. Is it
not possible that the Eugenist, finding his fundamentals
in biology, by emphasizing the facts
of the possibility and the necessity of controlling
human evolution, may be able to bring to
society a vital sense of the importance of this
science with a directness and a vividness which
the bacteriologist and hygienist have not been
able thus far to realize? Is it even too much to
hope that the idea that the "humanities" include
only the study of man's comparatively recent
past, may now more rapidly give place to
a broader conception which shall include not
only the whole of man's past, but the study of
his future as well? Could any ideal be more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
vitally, more profoundly human or more worthy
of study and devotion, than this of the production
of a race of men, clean and sound in mind
and body? Be that as it may, the development
of this bio-social field can scarcely fail to stimulate
strongly the treatment of all social problems
with a strictly scientific method. Nothing
less than exact methods, and results exactly
stated, will satisfy the genuine and really valuable
social student of the near future. As one
recent writer has feelingly put it: "We have
had essays enough."</p>

<p>Eugenic practice for the immediate future is
the third part of our program. Must we wait
until more data are collected, more facts uncovered,
before we undertake any definite proposals
for eugenic procedure? Although this is the
most difficult aspect of the subject, largely
through lack of a sufficiently broad fact-basis,
yet we are certainly in possession of enough information
to make plain a few necessary steps.
Most of the concrete proposals directed toward
the reduction of the undesirables and the increase
of the desirables have been visionary,
impractical, or too limited in their view-point.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
Above all, they have been open to the objection
that they have gone too far in the direction of
that zone which separates the two classes. It
should be said again that most of these proposals
have been those of the amateur enthusiast,
not of the seriously scientific Eugenist; they
have grown out of that common habit of "getting
far from the facts and philosophizing about
them."</p>

<p>As Pearson points out, we must start from
three fundamental biological ideas. First,
"That the relative weight of nature and nurture
must not <i>a priori</i> be assumed but must be scientifically
measured; and thus far our experience
is that nature dominates nurture, and that inheritance
is more vital than environment." Second,
"That there exists no demonstrable inheritance
of acquired characters. Environment
modifies the bodily characters of the existing
generation, but does not [often] modify the
germ plasms from which the next generation
springs. At most, environment can provide a
selection of which germ plasms among the many
provided shall be potential and which shall remain
latent." Third, "That all human qualities
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
are inherited in a marked and probably
equal degree." "If these ideas represent the
substantial truth, you will see how the whole
function of the eugenist is theoretically simplified.
He cannot hope by nurture and by education
to create new germinal types. He can only
hope by selective environment to obtain the
types most conducive to racial welfare and to
national progress. If we see this point clearly
and grasp it to the full, what a flood of light it
sheds on half the schemes for the amelioration
of the people.... The widely prevalent notion
that bettered environment and improved education
mean a <i>progressive</i> evolution of humanity
is found to be without any satisfactory scientific
basis. Improved conditions of life mean better
health for the existing population; greater educational
facilities mean greater capacity for
finding and using existing ability; they do not
connote that the next generation will be either
physically or mentally better than its parents.
Selection of parentage is the sole effective process
known to science by which a race can continuously
progress. The rise and fall of nations
are in truth summed up in the maintenance or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
cessation of that process of selection. Where
the battle is to the capable and thrifty, where
the dull and idle have no chance to propagate
their kind, there the nation will progress, even
if the land be sterile, the environment unfriendly
and educational facilities small."</p>

<p>As a concrete example of a most commendable
eugenic practice we should mention the
sterilization of certain classes of criminal and
insane as it is now practiced in the States of
Indiana and Connecticut. For the last four
years (since March, 1907) the laws of Indiana
have permitted the performance of the operation
of vasectomy upon "confirmed criminals,
idiots, rapists, and imbeciles" after rigid scrutiny
of all the mental and physical conditions of
the individual case and upon the concurrent
judgment of three competent and impartial persons.
The title and significant parts of the text
of this law are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>An Act</i>, entitled, An Act to prevent procreation of confirmed
criminals, idiots, imbeciles, and rapists&mdash;providing
that superintendents, or boards of managers, of institutions
where such persons are confined shall have the authority,
and are empowered to appoint a committee of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
experts, consisting of two physicians, to examine into the
mental condition of such inmates.</p>

<p><i>Whereas</i>, Heredity plays a most important part in the
transmission of crime, idiocy, and imbecility;</p>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, Be it enacted by the General Assembly of
the State of Indiana, That on and after the passage of
this act it shall be compulsory for each and every institution
in the State, entrusted with the care of confirmed
criminals, idiots, rapists, and imbeciles, to appoint upon
its staff, in addition to the regular institutional physician,
two (2) skilled surgeons of recognized ability, whose
duty it shall be, in conjunction with the chief physician
of the institution, to examine the mental and physical
condition of such inmates as are recommended by the institutional
physician and board of managers. If, in the
judgment of this committee of experts and the board of
managers, procreation is inadvisable, and there is no probability
of improvement of the mental and physical condition
of the inmate, it shall be lawful for the surgeons
to perform such operation for the prevention of procreation
as shall be decided safest and most effective. But
this operation shall not be performed except in cases that
have been pronounced unimprovable: Provided, That in
no case shall the consultation fee be more than three (3)
dollars to each expert, to be paid out of the funds appropriated
for the maintenance of such institution.</p></div>

<p>This operation of vasectomy, sometimes
known as "Rentoul's operation," consists, in the
male, in the removal of a small portion of each
sperm duct; the individual is thus rendered
sterile in a completely effective and permanent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
way. At the same time there are none of the
harmful effects, either physical or mental, such
as usually follow the better known forms of
sterilization which are in reality asexualization
rather than sterilization. Vasectomy is a simple
"office" operation occupying only a few
minutes and requiring at the most the application
of only a local an&aelig;sthetic, such as cocaine;
and there are no disturbing nor even inconvenient
after effects. In the female the corresponding
operation of o&ouml;phorotomy consists in
removing a small portion of each Fallopian
tube. In Indiana nearly a thousand persons
have already been successfully treated, many
upon their own request&mdash;a circumstance entirely
unforeseen. Similar laws have been
passed in Oregon and Connecticut, and are
being carefully considered in several other
States.</p>

<p>In order that the exact nature of such proposals
may be better known generally we may
give here also the text of the Connecticut law
which is somewhat more inclusive and more flexible
than that of Indiana. The Connecticut
Statute, enacted in August, 1909, is as follows:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>An Act</i>, concerning operations for the Prevention of
Procreation.&mdash;Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
Representatives in General Assembly convened:</p>

<p><i>Section 1.</i> The directors of the State prison and the
superintendents of State hospitals for the insane at Middletown
and Norwich are hereby authorized and directed
to appoint for each of said institutions, respectively, two
skilled surgeons, who, in conjunction with the physician
or surgeon in charge at each of said institutions, shall
examine such persons as are reported to them by the
warden, superintendent, or the physician or surgeon in
charge, to be persons by whom procreation would be inadvisable.</p>

<p>Such board shall examine the physical and mental condition
of such persons, and their record and family history
so far as the same can be ascertained, and if in the
judgment of the majority of said board, procreation by
any such person would produce children with an inherited
tendency to crime, insanity, feeble-mindedness, idiocy, or
imbecility, and there is no probability that the condition
of any such person so examined will improve to such an
extent as to render procreation by such person advisable,
or, if the physical and mental condition of any such person
will be substantially improved thereby, then the said
board shall appoint one of its members to perform the
operation of vasectomy or o&ouml;phorectomy, as the case may
be, upon such person. Such operation shall be performed
in a safe and humane manner, and the board making such
examination, and the surgeon performing such operation,
shall receive from the State such compensation, for services
rendered, as the warden of the State prison or the
superintendent of either of such hospitals shall deem
reasonable.</p>

<p><i>Section 2.</i> Except as authorized by this Act, every person
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
who shall perform, encourage, assist in, or otherwise
promote the performance of either of the operations described
in Section 1 of this Act, for the purpose of
destroying the power to procreate the human species; or
any person who shall knowingly permit either of such
operations to be performed upon such person&mdash;unless the
same be a medical necessity&mdash;shall be fined not more than
one thousand dollars, or imprisoned in the State prison
not more than five years, or both.</p></div>

<p>These States are to be commended in the highest
possible terms for their enlightened action in
this direction. Who can say how many families
of Jukes and Zeros have already been inhibited
by this simple and humane means? "Could
such a law be enforced in the whole United
States, less than four generations would eliminate
nine tenths of the crime, insanity and sickness
of the present generation in our land.
Asylums, prisons and hospitals would decrease,
and the problems of the unemployed, the indigent
old, and the hopelessly degenerate would
cease to trouble civilization."</p>

<p>And yet probably for years to come those
mental states and conditions of servitude graciously
termed "conservatism" will continue to
insure an undiminished horde of these unfortunates.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
The situation here is interestingly analogous
to that in connection with certain of the
infectious diseases. Concerning the eradication
of typhoid fever, to mention a single concrete
example, competent authorities declare
that we now possess all of the information
necessary to make typhoid fever as obsolete in
civilized communities as is cholera or smallpox.
"The average third-year medical student knows
enough about typhoid fever to be able to stamp
it out if he were endowed with absolute power."
"Typhoid fever has passed beyond the catalogue
of diseases; it is a crime." Our knowledge
of the causes of many of the conditions
leading to gross physical and mental defect and
criminality has progressed already to such a
point that we could if we would eradicate them
in large proportion from our civilization. The
great horde of defectives, once in the world,
have the right to live and to enjoy as best they
may whatever freedom is compatible with the
lives and freedom of the other members of society.
They have not the right to produce and
reproduce more of their kind for a too generous
and too blindly "charitable" society to contend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
against. The greater crime consists in allowing
the hereditary criminal to be born.</p>

<p>A well-known British alienist, Tredgold,
after pointing out that the duty of medical science
is to fight and relieve disease in every shape
and form, adds: "That if social science does
not keep pace with medical science in this matter
the end will be national disaster. In other
words, I would lay it down as a general principle
that as soon as a nation reaches that stage
of civilization in which medical knowledge and
humanitarian sentiment operate to prolong the
existence of the unfit, then it becomes imperative
upon that nation to devise such social laws
as will insure that these unfit do not propagate
their kind.</p>

<p>"For, mark you, it is not as if these degenerates
mated solely amongst themselves. Were
that so, it is possible that, even in spite of the
physician, the accumulated morbidity would become
so powerful as to work out its own salvation
by bringing about the sterility and extinction
of its victims. The danger lies in the fact
that these degenerates mate with the <i>healthy</i>
members of the community and thereby constantly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
drag fresh blood into the vortex of disease
and lower the general vigour of the nation."</p>

<p>Such a practice as vasectomy then represents
nicely the eugenic aim of allowing the individual,
who is himself never to be blamed for his
hereditary constitution, the greatest possible
personal freedom and liberty, of allowing full
play of sympathy for the individual, and at the
same time of exercising the greatest sympathy
to society in prohibiting the hereditary criminal
from procreating a long line of descendants endowed
as badly as he himself was through no
fault of his own, but through the gross neglect
of society.</p>

<p>Another quotation from Pearson: "To-day
we feed our criminals up, and we feed up our
insane, we let both out of the prison or asylum
'reformed' or 'cured,' as the case may be, only
after a few months to return to State supervision,
leaving behind them the germs of a new
generation of deteriorants. The average number
of crimes due to the convicts in his Majesty's
prisons to-day is ten apiece. We cannot
reform the criminal, nor cure the insane from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the standpoint of heredity; the taint varies not
with their mental or moral conduct. These are
the products of the somatic cells; the disease
lies deeper in their germinal constitution. Education
for the criminal, fresh air for the tuberculous,
rest and food for the neurotic&mdash;these
are excellent, they may bring control, sound
lungs, and sanity to the individual; but they
will not save the offspring from the need of like
treatment, nor from the danger of collapse when
the time of strain comes. They cannot make
a nation sound in mind and body, they merely
screen degeneracy behind a throng of arrested
degenerates. Our highly developed human
sympathy will no longer allow us to watch the
State purify itself by the aid of crude natural
selection. We see pain and suffering only to relieve
it, without inquiry as to the moral character
of the sufferer or as to his national or racial
value. And this is right&mdash;no man is responsible
for his own being; and nature and nurture,
over which he had no control, have made him
the being he is, good or evil. But here science
steps in, crying: Let the reprieve be accepted,
but next remind the social conscience of its duty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
to the race ... let there be no heritage if you
would build up and preserve a virile and efficient
people. Here, I hold, we reach the kernel
of the truth which the science of eugenics has
at present revealed."</p>

<p>It is also a part of eugenic practice to oppose
vigorously and unmistakably any social practice
leading to the reduction in the reproductivity
of the desirable and valuable elements of
society. There is to be included here for censure
a long list of customs and practices, from
the enforced celibacy of the Church to the horror
of horrors&mdash;warfare. A moment's reflection
will suggest many reprehensible practices
of this kind more or less current in certain
classes or communities. The requirement of
nonmarriage on the part of women teachers&mdash;persons
of tested and demonstrated ability, is a
very general practice of decidedly noneugenic
character. In Great Britain more than 75,000
nurses, all of whom must have passed physical
examination, are cut off from reproduction by
the same requirement of nonmarriage. Many
less striking but all too common practices have
the final effect of forbidding marriage to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
healthy, physically or mentally capable, helpful,
classes. "Help wanted. Must be unencumbered."</p>

<p>More vigorously and more unmistakably does
the Eugenist discourage anything that leads to
matings of the unfit and, above all, to their reproduction.
Many countries, from Servia to
the Argentine Republic, have statutes forbidding
the marriage of the insane, idiots, deaf and
dumb, certain classes of criminals, and persons
afflicted with certain contagious diseases. It is
to be hoped that these laws are enforced with
greater effectiveness than that with which our
own less stringent laws of similar character
are administered. After all, it is the reproduction
of these persons that should be limited, and
among many of these classes the fact of nonmarriage
would provide not the slightest barrier
to reproduction.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately true, but true none the
less, that there are current forms of so-called
philanthropy which, by relieving defective parents
of the care of their defective offspring,
thus encourage them in the production of more
defective offspring; and so the flames are fed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Relief is the smallest part of the problem. Any
condition which leads to the multiplication of
the innately defective and dependent classes
must be sternly opposed. No matter how benign
the guise of any form of relief or charity, if it
encourages or permits even indirectly the free
reproduction of these classes, it must be resolutely
opposed and soon abandoned. "It is not
enough to preach with horror and indignation
against normal parents who restrict their families.
Equal reprobation should be the lot of
those who, with inherited insanity, feeble-mindedness,
or disease, bring children into the world
to perpetuate their infirmities. It should not be
overlooked that the realization of the power of
limiting the birth rate, while it has produced
untold harm, when applied blindly and in accordance
with individual caprice, may become
an instrument for good if it extends to the worst
stocks, while the better stocks once more undertake
their natural duties."</p>

<p>Practical Eugenics need not be limited to its
philanthropic and legislative aspects. There
are other social mechanisms which could be used
to encourage the multiplication of the fitter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
abler families. In Munich, under the enlightened
leadership of Dr. Alfred Ploetz, a society
for the study and promotion of social and racial
hygiene (Internationale Gesellschaft f&uuml;r Rassen-Hygiene)
has made a most excellent and significant
beginning. This society is doing much
not only to collect data and investigate scientifically
problems within its field, but also to
spread widely the facts of racial integrity. Its
members agree, among other things, to undergo
thorough medical examination prior to marriage
as to their fitness for that state and agree
to abstain from marriage, or at least from parenthood,
if found to be unfit.</p>

<p>Much can be done by suggestion and suasion
regarding the choice of mates and the rearing
of large families. When one touches upon this
subject he is pretty likely to be met with the
objection that the selection of mates is so largely
an impulsive, emotional affair that it is quite
beyond control. "Marriages," they say, "are
made in heaven." But when we consider the
number that can scarcely be said to be completed
there the statement seems open to some
question. As a matter of fact, it is perfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
clear, as Galton, Ellis, and others have shown,
that all peoples, from the Kaffir and the Dyak to
the Hindu and the modern European or American,
are surrounded with restrictions in marriage
often of the greatest stringency. And yet,
since these are matters of established social custom,
even of religious observance, we submit
almost without knowing it.</p>

<p>That results can be really accomplished in
this direction and by this method is clearly
shown by the history of the Jewish people, and
by the Roman Catholics, among whom there are
distinctly fewer divorces and childless marriages
than among Protestants. In many countries
and communities the organized Church
still exercises an immense influence over the
whole subject of marriage: the Church could
easily become a powerful factor in eugenic practice.
Such a control can and should be given
eugenic direction by the establishment of a more
discriminative attitude, looking toward a reduction
in the reproductivity of the dependent or
defective as well as to the increased reproductivity
of the valuable and able. In all of the
discussion of "race suicide" and the value to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the State of the large family, how seldom do we
hear any mention of quality! To plan the organization
and conduct of a State without regulating
and controlling the quality of its membership
is like adopting plans and elevations for a
costly building without making any specifications
as to materials.</p>

<p>In concrete eugenic practice it seems probable
that most can be accomplished for the present
by striving to limit the multiplication of the
undesirable, dependent, or dangerous elements
of the social group. There can be less uncertainty
here. The social organization has already
marked certain kinds of individuals as
unfit and unworthy, whose liberty must be limited
in many directions for the social welfare.
This aspect of the matter can be put upon a
dollars and cents basis very clearly, and this is
apparently the only relation that affects a good
many people. Why should the able and worthy
and thrifty members of society be compelled to
pay, as they are in this country alone, $100,000,000
annually, not to mention the vast sums voluntarily
contributed toward "charitable" purposes,
for the support of the criminal and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
pauper and defective classes who themselves
contribute nothing of value and whose very existence
is evidence of criminal disregard of the
right of every individual to be well born, into a
healthy and sane life? The only answer, if it
be an answer, is&mdash;because the competent are
willing to foot the bill. Millions for tribute but
not one cent for defense. And yet a penny's
worth of defense outweighs a million's worth of
cure.</p>

<p>In the practice of Eugenics the greatest caution
must be exercised. All eugenic practice
must be tested by the most careful and scrutinizing
scientific methods. Mendelian heredity
gives a different answer from Job's to his own
query: "Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean?" It also makes clear how it may often
happen that it needs but three generations to go
from Fifth Avenue to the Bowery, and back
again. Many so-called criminals may be anachronisms,
some only modificationally bad.
But there are many cases, many practices, regarding
which there can be no doubt: the Eugenist
says, treat these, and let the doubtful
cases alone until as a result of the increase of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
knowledge there is no doubt. And while it is
easy to say that we <i>believe</i> the criminal or the
insane are the products of a wrong environment,
it is also easy to say that we believe they
are not. What the Eugenist demands is <i>knowledge</i>,
then belief, and action based thereon.</p>

<p>Finally, the eugenic program calls for the
spread of the facts, far and wide, through all
classes of society. Bring forcibly before the
people the facts of human heredity. Teach
them to understand the force of the eugenic
ideal of good breeding. "The prevalent opinion
that almost anybody is good enough to
marry is chiefly due to the fact that in this case,
cause and effect, marriage and the feebleness of
offspring, are so distant from each other that
the near-sighted eye does not distinctly perceive
the connection between them." By education
we must produce first of all a thoughtfulness
in the community regarding the racial responsibilities
of marriage and reproduction. Human
beings are frequently rational creatures; placing
before them clear and truthful ideas regarding
fit and unfit matings cannot fail of an ultimate
effect. "The virtue of repetition, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
summation of suggestion, which sells pills and
pickles, which makes Free Trade or Tariff Reform
a national issue, this force operating as a
slight but persistent influence when linked to
eugenic proposals will in a few years' time make
these proposals a living force to the common
man." By talking and teaching, in season and
out, the community will be compelled to think
on these things; they will be forced into the
public conscience and the pressure of public
opinion will rise for the eugenic and against
the noneugenic ideals of mating and the rearing
of families. And the rest will come in due season
and more effective and permanent results
will follow than are likely to come from any
amount of premature legislation. As Galton
writes: "The enlightenment of the individual
is a necessary preamble to practical Eugenics,
but social opinion by praise or blame constantly
influences individual conduct." "Public
opinion is commonly far in advance of private
morality, because society as a whole keenly appreciates
acts that tend to its advantage, and
condemns those that do not. It applauds acts
of heroism that perhaps not one of the applaud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>ers
would be disposed to emulate." "The first
and main point is to secure the general intellectual
acceptance of Eugenics as a hopeful and
most important study. Then let its principles
work into the heart of the nation, who will gradually
give practical effect to them in ways that
we may not wholly foresee."</p>

<p>In this educational part of the eugenic program,
and particularly in the encouragement
of research directed toward the solution
of eugenic problems and the establishment of
eugenic practices, there lies one of the greatest
opportunities ever opened to the philanthropist.
The genuine philanthropist is he who
would at this moment make possible the rapid
solution of many of the still baffling problems
of human heredity and who would help to
spread and teach the gospel of true racial integrity.
But while it has been easy to interest
philanthropists in the relief of social disorders,
few can be interested in the causes at work
which make the necessity for relief seem so imperative.</p>

<p>The patient unraveler of the Jukes family
history has said, "I am informed that $28,000
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
was raised in two days to purchase a rare collection
of antique jewelry and bronze recently
discovered in classic ground forty feet below
the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. I do not hear of as many pence being
offered to fathom the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of our civilization&mdash;however
rich the yield!" Possibly one
reason for this neglect or omission has heretofore
been the lack of evidence that real results
could be accomplished in this field. Now that
it is so obvious that we have a real foundation
of fact from which to work we may expect soon
some degree of recognition of the supreme importance
of the need for investigation in subjects
allied to Eugenics, and of devotion to eugenic
aims.</p>

<p>"Whether or no the importance of the issues
at stake comes to be recognized fully by the nation
at large, individuals and families have it in
their power to act on the knowledge they have
acquired.... When once more the importance
of good birth comes to be recognized in a new
sense, ... it will be understood to be more important
to marry into a family with a good
hereditary record of physical, mental, and moral
qualities than it ever has been considered to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
allied to one with sixteen quarterings." "Families
in which good and noble qualities of mind
and body have become hereditary form a natural
aristocracy, and, if such families take pride
in recording their pedigrees, marry among
themselves, and establish a predominant fertility,
they can assure success and position to
the majority of their descendants in any political
future. They can become the guardians
and trustees of a sound inborn heritage, which,
incorruptible and undefiled, they can preserve
in purity and vigour throughout whatever period
of ignorance and decay may be in store for
the nation at large. Neglect to hand on undimmed
the priceless germinal qualities which
such families possess, can be regarded only as
the betrayal of a sacred trust....</p>

<p>"We look, then, for a day in the near future,
when, in some circles at any rate, a comparison
of scientific pedigrees will replace, or at all
events precede, the discussion of settlements in
the preliminaries to a marriage; when birth and
good-breeding (in its wide sense), character
and ability will be the qualities most prized in
the choice of mates; when a bad ancestral strain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
likely to reappear in succeeding generations
will suppress an incipient passion as effectually
as it is now cured by a deficiency of education
or a superfluity of accent." (Whetham.)</p>

<p>As matters are at present it is all too often
the case that marriage is <i>followed</i> by the disclosure
or discovery of a family history of sterility,
or criminality, or insanity. In a truly enlightened
society the failure to make known
such conditions in the antecedents to a marriage
will be regarded as evidence of the greatest
moral obliquity, if not of criminal misdemeanor.</p>

<p>The wise and honored founder of Eugenics
looks forward to the inclusion of eugenic ideals
as a factor in religion. "Eugenics," Galton
writes, "strengthens the sense of social duty
in so many important particulars that the conclusions
derived from its study ought to find a
welcome home in every tolerant religion."
"Eugenic belief extends the function of philanthropy
to future generations; it renders its action
more pervading than hitherto, by dealing
with families and societies in their entirety;
and it enforces the importance of the marriage
covenant, by directing serious attention to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
probable quality of the future offspring. It
strongly forbids all forms of sentimental charity
that are harmful to the race, while it eagerly
seeks opportunity for acts of personal kindness
as some equivalent to the loss of what it forbids.
It brings the tie of kinship into prominence,
and strongly encourages love and interest
in family and race. In brief, eugenics is a
virile creed, full of hopefulness, and appealing
to many of the noblest feelings of our nature."</p>

<p>And Whetham adds: "Hitherto the development
of our race has been unconscious, and we
have been allowed no responsibility for its right
course. Now, in the fulness of time ... we
are treated as children no more, and the conscious
fashioning of the human race is given
into our hands. Let us put away childish
things, stand up with open eyes, and face our responsibilities."</p>
